It‚Äôs great,‚Äù he said.\n‚ÄúIf you want to create power, you need looseness.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the reasons why he has so much power in his game.\n‚ÄúI like the left arm because I‚Äôve always said it‚Äôs very important to let the left arm go to the side when you serve because it creates natural rotation of the body, and natural rotation of the body creates natural power.\n‚ÄúYou need that rotation.‚Äù\nPhoto by MARTIN KEEP/AFP via Getty Images\nAlcaraz made a big change to his serve\nduring the off-season, as he explained the struggles he was having ahead of the 2025 Australian Open.\n‚ÄúI just worked as much as I could during the pre-season to do a good serve,‚Äù he said.\n‚ÄúRight now I am still thinking about it, I am still reminding myself how I have to do it.\n‚ÄúI think there are times that I feel there is a problem with it, because sometimes in the matches that I played or in the practice I am not doing the right things, so I have to keep thinking about it.‚Äù\nThe Spaniard put those problems behind him in the second round of the Australian Open, serving at his brilliant best in a three-set win over Yoshihito Nishioka.\nAces ‚Äì 14\nFirst serve percentage ‚Äì 60%\nWin percentage on first serve ‚Äì 89%\nWin percentage on second serve ‚Äì 81%\nHow does Carlos Alcaraz‚Äôs serve compare to the rest of the ATP Tour?\nAlcaraz‚Äôs serve has improved dramatically over the past 12 months and is now considered to be one of the best on the ATP Tour.\nThe Spaniard‚Äôs ‚ÄòServe Rating‚Äô, a statistic that combines measures such as first serve % and average number of aces per match, currently sits at 283.5, a number bettered by just nine players in men‚Äôs tennis.\nRank\nName\nServe Rating\n% First serve\n% First serve points won\n% Second serve points won\n% Service games won\nAverage aces/match\nAverage double faults/match\n1\nGiovanni Mpetshi Perricard\n302.1\n64.8\n79.7\n53.8\n90.0\n19.3\n5.5\n2\nAlexander Zverev\n298.1\n70.4\n76.9\n54.2\n89.7\n9.2\n2.3\n3\nMatteo Berrettini\n297.3\n68.3\n77.5\n53.2\n89.8\n10.1\n1.6\n4\nJannik Sinner\n296.5\n61.1\n79.8\n58.5\n91.4\n7.6\n1.9\n5\nTaylor Fritz\n295.3\n62.7\n79.1\n55.7\n89.2\n10.4\n1.8\n6\nBen Shelton\n294.5\n68.2\n76.0\n54.9\n89.5\n9.3\n3.4\n7\nHubert Hurkacz\n293.4\n63.4\n77.1\n54.1\n87.9\n12.5\n1.6\n8\nBrandon Nakashima\n292.6\n66.2\n74.8\n56.2\n87.9\n8.2\n1.2\n9\nNovak Djokovic\n285.7\n63.9\n75.0\n55.7\n86.6\n7.1\n2.6\n10\nCarlos Alcaraz\n283.5\n64.6\n73.5\n56.9\n85.8\n5.0\n2.3\nATP Tour ‚ÄòServe Rating‚Äô over the past 52 weeks\nFrenchman\nGiovanni Mpetshi Perricard\ncurrently holds the top spot, thanks to his excellent serving performances during his 2024 breakout season.\nPhoto by Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images\nAlcaraz will look to chase down Mpetshi Perricard and climb the rankings further when he returns to action in Indian Wells, on March 3.\nATP\nCarlos Alcaraz\nPatrick Mouratoglou"

                "Playing sports as part of a healthy and active lifestyle with good nutrition will often lead to people living longer lives - and a brain doctor has now named the three surprising sports which increase longevity.\nDr Daniel Amen - a psychiatrist and brain disorder specialist - has highlighted the merits of playing sports which involve using a racquet as the trio which can lead to people living longer lives.\nMany of us have played these sports recreationally both in childhood and our adult lives, while all three have professional options available for people to make a career out of it.\nIt might have been assumed that certain non-contact sports which involve a lot of cardiovascular activity - such as track athletics, long distance running, and road cycling - would be the sports which can increase lifespan.\nAdvert\nBut Dr Amen has explained why playing racquet sports for just 30 minutes twice a week can be so beneficial to longevity because of the stimulating impact it has on the brain, as well as the rest of the body.\nTennis\nis one of the most popular global sports professionally, while table tennis also has a big following and features in the Olympics.\nAnd pickleball has grown in popularity in recent years, particularly in the United States where it was estimated to have 13.6m players in 2023 and has been the fastest growing sport in the country for three years in a row at the start of this decade.\nDr Daniel Amen. (Image: Getty)\nAdvert\nSpeaking on an unnamed podcast\n, Dr Amen said: \"People who play racquet sports live longer than everybody else.\n\"This is a replicated study on like 90,000 people, because what co-ordination does it is activates your cerebellum, little brain, which is 10% of the brain's volume in the back and has half the brain's neurons.\n\"If you activate that, it turns on the rest of your brain. So I'm a huge fan of table tennis and pickleball and tennis.\n\"Just go and learn to be good and you don't have to beat people.\nAdvert\n\"If you spent half an hour twice a week, it'll have a major impact on your ability to think.\n\"Because you got to get your eyes, hands and feet all working together while you think about the spin on the ball.

But what if your mom is a five-time Grand Slam champion and a former World No. 1? That‚Äôs the case for Theodore, the son of Russian tennis star\nMaria Sharapova\nand her fianc√©, Alexander Gilkes. The couple, who started dating in 2018 and announced their engagement in December 2020, welcomed their son on July 1, 2022. Fans have gotten occasional glimpses of their life through social media. But while some might expect Theodore to inherit his mom‚Äôs love for tennis, it turns out the two-year-old has other ideas.\nOn Saturday, February 22, Sharapova shared a series of\nInstagram Stories\ndocumenting Theodore‚Äôs brief attempt at the sport. Let‚Äôs just say his interest didn‚Äôt last long. ‚Äú\nIt lasted less than a minuteüòÇ,\n‚Äù she captioned the post. With her son completely uninterested, the former World No.1 had no choice but to keep playing on her own.‚Äú\nI guess I‚Äôll just play myself,‚Äù\nshe joked.\nIt‚Äôs a funny twist, considering how much tennis has shaped her life. And last year, she had the chance to relive some of her most iconic moments at the place where it all started.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nMaria Sharapova took the tennis world by storm when she won her first Grand Slam at just 17, defeating Serena Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final. Fast forward two decades, and she returned to the All England Club‚Äîthis time, not as a competitor but as a former champion with her fianc√©, Alexander Gilkes, and their son, Theodore, by her side.\nSharapova took a moment to show Theodore her name on the list of champions, a piece of history that might mean more to him someday. For now, though, he seemed more interested in everything else happening around him. The toddler was spotted waving at ball kids as they passed by, soaking in the atmosphere of one of tennis‚Äô most famous venues. He even had the chance to watch reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz practice on an outside court‚Äîa moment most tennis fans would dream of.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Maria Sharapova (@mariasharapova)\nDespite being surrounded by tennis history, Theodore doesn‚Äôt seem too interested in following in his mom‚Äôs footsteps.

While she acknowledges that raising a child is a ‚Äúfull-time job,‚Äù she also finds immense joy in watching ‚Äúthis little human grow‚Äù and express himself.\nIn June, the former World No. 1 opened up to PEOPLE about how her tennis career unexpectedly prepared her for motherhood.‚Äú\nI think in some ways there were so many elements of my sport that I could apply into motherhood,\n‚Äù she said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe 5-time Grand Slam champion explained that the discipline and structure she followed throughout her career have played a big role in how she approaches parenting. The 37-year-old added, ‚Äú\nJust the discipline of the schedules and routines and seeing the benefit of that through their behavior and through their eyes has also been really helpful. When I was playing, knowing where I was going to be and when I was going to nap and when I was going to eat helped me so much with my energy.‚Äù\nMaria Sharapova may no longer be competing on the court, but in this new chapter of her life, she‚Äôs winning in a different way.

It says one big thing, how loose he is, how relaxed.\n‚ÄúThere is no muscular tension that prevents his leg from going so far back and high.\n‚ÄúThere is no muscular tension that prevents his left arm from going far to the left.‚Äù\nPhoto by Alex Pantling/Getty Images\nMouratoglou then rated Alcaraz‚Äôs serve, as he seemed impressed by the Spaniard‚Äôs efforts so far this year.\n‚ÄúHow good is it?

                "Teenage squash player Ella Lash experienced highs and lows in 2024, but now she‚Äôs ready to once again play the best players in the world, and as fortune would have it, it‚Äôll be here in New Zealand.\nThe 19-year-old Lash is currently ranked number two in New Zealand and has been awarded a wildcard for the second successive year for next month‚Äôs 2025 NZ Squash Open in Christchurch alongside New Zealand number one, Joelle King.\nJoining the Kiwis in the 24-player draw are nine of the top-20-ranked players in the world, a challenge which Lash is relishing.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm super excited and lucky to have got it [the wildcard] again. I don‚Äôt think many people get the chance to get two in a row, but I‚Äôm excited to get the chance to play alongside Joelle,‚Äù Lash says.\nLash has had sustained international success at junior levels and is currently ranked 127 in the world among the seniors. She‚Äôs won New Zealand U19, Oceania U19 and NZ Junior Open titles, and a career highlight came in April last year when she won the Australian Junior Open title.\nLash after winning the U19 Junior Australian Open in Melbourne in April 2024. Photo: Supplied\n‚ÄúJust holding up that trophy was so incredible. To be down two-love in the final and then win three games to two, I was so happy to come out the other side of that,‚Äù Lash says.\nJust days later however, Lash suffered a seizure during the Oceania Junior Championships in Australia. It was her second seizure in a matter of months.\n‚ÄúI was on my way to the British Junior Open late in 2023. We were in Los Angeles on a stopover of about 12 hours. We got back to the airport a couple of hours before we were flying out and I ended up having a seizure at the airport out of nowhere. So I got taken to a hospital that was near the airport and stayed there for 24 hours,‚Äù Lash says.\n‚ÄúThey did a whole pile of tests and everything came back clean which was really good. They thought that it might have been dehydration or something like that, as I was quite fatigued from the flight over, so I got put on medication and got stuck in LA for three days before we could fly out to London to get to this tournament.‚Äù\nDespite only arriving the night before the tournament, Lash still placed 20th out of 64. But when she returned to New Zealand it was time to seek help. Unfortunately, she hasn‚Äôt had a definitive diagnosis to date, with one neurologist‚Äôs theory that it was epilepsy not stacking up after she had tests. She hasn‚Äôt been able to drive for the past year. Her own recollections of the seizures are limited, so she feels more for family and friends who witnessed them.\n‚ÄúI consider myself a bit lucky that I don‚Äôt really remember or recall what happened because I had memory loss from it, but it was a bit of a shock for everyone,‚Äù Lash says.\n‚ÄúThe last year‚Äôs been a rough journey but I haven‚Äôt had one since [April] and everything looks really good at the moment.‚Äù\nBorn in Wellington, Lash started playing squash at an early age and it was always King that she looked up to.\n‚ÄúI started squash at seven and have looked up to her since then, so she‚Äôs definitely the one that I go to and look up to for inspiration,‚Äù Lash says.\n‚ÄúI started off playing tennis so I‚Äôd already been into racquet sports but I randomly one day went down to the squash court to watch my dad and my uncle play and I think ever since then I picked up a racquet for the first time and I haven‚Äôt really dropped it since.‚Äù\nShortly after she started playing, Lash moved to Auckland with her family and after a couple of years she started to play more competitively, but it was only towards the end of 2022 that she decided she wanted to do it full-time and professionally.\n‚ÄúIt got to that point where I had the natural talent and then I decided in 2022 that‚Äôs what I wanted to do full-time and I started taking it a lot more seriously,‚Äù Lash says.\nGraduating from Selwyn College in 2023, she took 2024 as a gap year, although she‚Äôs doing some online study this year after and works part-time to help cover the costs of travelling to tournaments.\nAn embrace from Kiwi No 1 Joelle King after the NZ Squash Open final in July 2024.  Photo: Supplied\nLast July, Lash met King in the final of the New Zealand championships, losing three sets to one. It was King‚Äôs 11th national title, beating Dame Susan Devoy‚Äôs 32-year-old record of 10 national titles.\n‚ÄúThat was my dream ever since I was a little kid. To play her in a match one day and get on court with her was a super surreal experience,‚Äù Lash says.\nJonathan Kemp,  the national performance coach for Squash New Zealand has been looking after Lash over the past year or so and he is delighted with her attitude.\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs one of our brightest stars. Her development over the past couple of years has been really impressive. All the things she‚Äôs had to deal with have made it very difficult for her, but she‚Äôs never complained, she‚Äôs always looking for solutions and how to figure things out and those are the kinds of attitudes and behaviours that successful people have,‚Äù Kemp says.\n‚ÄúShe has a great attitude and works incredibly hard. She‚Äôs made really good improvements in pretty much all areas of her game, which means looking forward to the future, we‚Äôre all really excited about her potential. She has a chance to get right up there and be amongst the best players in the world in a few years time.‚Äù\nLash helping out young players at the 2024 Auckland Open PSA.  ‚ÄúTrying to inspire the next generation of juniors in NZ‚Äù. Photo: Supplied\nLash will possibly have the chance to go where the likes of Dame Susan Devoy never reached, with confirmation squash is on the programme for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\nWith Brisbane hosting the games in 2032, there‚Äôs also a chance of an Olympics on our doorstep.\n‚ÄúI think every sportsperson‚Äôs goal is to get to the Olympics and to get that medal for their country. I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to get that spot to go,‚Äù says Lash.\nBefore the City of Angels rears its head though, it‚Äôs the Garden City that‚Äôs first on Lash‚Äôs agenda and the chance to keep moving up the rankings and gaining experience.\nThe 2025 New Zealand Squash Open takes place between March 4 -9 at the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch\n.\nAiden McLaughlin\nAiden McLaughlin is a freelance sports writer.

But what if your mom is a five-time Grand Slam champion and a former World No. 1? That‚Äôs the case for Theodore, the son of Russian tennis star\nMaria Sharapova\nand her fianc√©, Alexander Gilkes. The couple, who started dating in 2018 and announced their engagement in December 2020, welcomed their son on July 1, 2022. Fans have gotten occasional glimpses of their life through social media. But while some might expect Theodore to inherit his mom‚Äôs love for tennis, it turns out the two-year-old has other ideas.\nOn Saturday, February 22, Sharapova shared a series of\nInstagram Stories\ndocumenting Theodore‚Äôs brief attempt at the sport. Let‚Äôs just say his interest didn‚Äôt last long. ‚Äú\nIt lasted less than a minuteüòÇ,\n‚Äù she captioned the post. With her son completely uninterested, the former World No.1 had no choice but to keep playing on her own.‚Äú\nI guess I‚Äôll just play myself,‚Äù\nshe joked.\nIt‚Äôs a funny twist, considering how much tennis has shaped her life.

For now, though, he seemed more interested in everything else happening around him. The toddler was spotted waving at ball kids as they passed by, soaking in the atmosphere of one of tennis‚Äô most famous venues.

                "Mohamud Ahmed\n, US Sports Writer\nPublished\n: Invalid Date,\nNone of the WTA's top three players have won a title this year.\nAfter recent struggles and upsets at the Australian Open, Dubai and Qatar Open, Iga Swiatek,\nCoco Gauff\nand Aryna Sabalenka are having a unusual start to their 2025.\n4\nIga Swiatek lost to 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva at the Dubai Duty Free Championships\nAfter\nlosing to Paula Badosa in the quarter-finals\nin Melbourne, Gauff, the world No.3 lost both her first matches at the Qatar and Dubai Open.\nThe American lost 6-2, 7-5 to Marta Kostuk in Doha, a match that was undone by familiar struggles with her serve and forehand, before enduring a 6-4, 7-5 defeat to fellow American McCartney Kessler in Dubai.\nMeanwhile, Sabalenka, the world No.1, lost to Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-3, 3-6, 6-7 in Doha before losing to Clara Tauson 7-6, 6-4 in Dubai as her poor post-Australian Open form.\nSwiatek, has made a deeper run in both Qatar and Dubai reaching the semi-finals and quarter-finals respectively but her defeats were upsets handed to her by lower ranked players.\nREAD MORE TENNIS\nCoco Gauff and Iga Swiatek defend WTA over ban on Elena Rybakina‚Äôs coach\nAryna Sabalenka bought special gift for Australian Open rival following prize money joke\nParticularity her Dubai loss, where the world No.2 lost to 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 6-3, in a match that sent shock waves around the tennis world.\nThe manner of these defeats from the WTA's three highest ranked players has left some wondering if there is a reason behind it.\nSwiatek believes there is a cause, singling out the WTA's scheduling as the issue and claiming it affects all the top ranked players on the tour.\n\"It‚Äôs a calendar thing. Like, we‚Äôre not going to be able to be consistent for many years playing week by week,‚Äù she told a reporter when asked about her struggles.\nMost read in Tennis\nI‚Äôm the first player to ever beat Serena Williams but retired at 21 to switch careers\n'It's a creepy story' - Emma Raducanu's coach reveals disturbing details of stalker ordeal\nTeen star Mirra Andreeva makes WTA history as 17-year-old pulls off major upset\nMan who 'exhibited fixated behaviour' towards Emma Raducanu given restraining order\n‚ÄúAlso it‚Äôs not like some time ago that outside of, like, top-20 players, they were just getting destroyed more. Now anybody can win these tournaments. It has been like that for a couple of years.\n‚ÄúBut I feel like the calendar is not helping. Again, like, we need to switch continents, we need to switch surfaces, we need to switch the balls. Yeah, it‚Äôs not easy. I‚Äôm not surprised.‚Äù\n4\nCoco Gauff lost her first match at the Dubai Duty Free Championships\n4\nAryna Sabalenka lost in the third round of the Dubai Duty Free Championships\nSwiatek's diagnosis makes sense when considering that many of the WTA's top 10 players have suffered with their form this year amidst a turbulent calendar.\nWorld No.4 Jasmine Paolini has won just four singles matches since the start of the year and was unable to defend the Dubai Open title.\nWhile world No.5 Jessica Pegula has registered just five victories, and lost her second match in Dubai against Linda Noskova, while world No.8 Qinwen Zheng has won just one match in 2025.\nWorld No.9 Emma Navarro had a strong start to the year, reaching the Australian Open quarter-finals but has won just two matches since.\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka has pinpointed the turnaround from being in Australia then to the Middle East for her drop in form.\n\"I'd say that for the last couple of years, I'm not doing well in the Middle East. I believe we need to change something in the preparation,\" said Sabalenka.\n4\nIga Swiatek is yet to win a title this year\n\"Because every time I don't feel well playing here, health-wise I'm struggling. Australia always taking a lot of energy out of me.\n\"I believe that I'm not that hungry on court. I'm kind of like all over the place in my thoughts and not consistent. The decisions I'm making on the court are a bit wrong, and emotionally, I'm not on my best.\"\nSabalenka will be hoping to quickly improve as the hard-court season, her most dominant surface, is coming to an end soon.\nIndiana Wells and the Miami Open begin in early March before the clay court season kicks off towards the end of the month.\nThe next Grand Slam, the French Open, a tournament Swiatek has won four times, begins May. 25.\nTopics\nAryna Sabalenka\nCoco Gauff\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek\nYOU MIGHT LIKE"

She will become the first 17-year-old to be ranked in the Top 10 since Nicole Vaidisova in 2007.\n\"Now when you enter Top 10 and the higher your ranking is, the slower and longer it's going to take for you to be even higher because the difference in the points is very, very short, very small,\" Andreeva said.\n\"I think it's going to be hard to enter Top 5. This is the exact goal that I'm going to set for myself, to be Top 5 by the end of the year. I'm very curious if I will be able to achieve it.\"\nPlayers on the rise:\nBoth contestants in Saturday's final had stellar weeks. The top 2 seeds, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, were not in this final because they were taken out by Tauson and Andreeva respectively.\nTauson cruised past Sabalenka in the Round of 16, underscoring an exceptional year. The Dane is the 2025 tour leader in match-wins (15) and is the only player to beat Madison Keys this season, in Auckland en route to her third career title.\nBut it was Andreeva who completed the week with the champion's trophy, after beating Swiatek in the quarterfinals and backing up that victory with a win over No. 6 seed Elena Rybakina in the semifinals.\nJimmie48/WTA\nThe 2023 WTA Newcomer of the Year, Andreeva extends her remarkable surge. In the past two decades, Andreeva is only the fifth player to win multiple WTA titles before turning 18, joining Maria Sharapova, Michaella Krajicek, Nicole Vaidisova and Coco Gauff.\nAnother fun fact: All three teenagers who have made a WTA 1000 final since 2020 have won the title (also Iga Swiatek at 2021 Rome and Coco Gauff at 2023 Cincinnati).\nMatch moments:\nA back-and-forth opening set saw Andreeva fall behind 2-0 after consecutive double faults, but the teen fired a backhand winner to immediately pull back on serve. Then, at 4-3, Andreeva triumphed in a lengthy rally with a winning forehand, which spurred her on to win eight of the next nine points and serve for the set at 5-4.\nTauson was not done yet, slamming a powerful forehand of her own to level the set at 5-5 without facing break point. But once the pair reached the tiebreak, Andreeva took charge, hitting an ace for 3-0 and dragging more errors from the Tauson racquet. Andreeva cruised through the breaker and earned a hard-fought one-set lead after exactly one hour.\n\"When I managed to win the first set, I felt like, 'Well, OK, this is I think one of the first times when I actually lead in the score,'\" Andreeva said. \"That gave me a bit of confidence.\"\n2 - Mirra Andreeva has won her maiden WTA-1000 title after 11 main draws ‚Äì the fewest since Paula Badosa (10) at Indian Wells in 2021. Future.\n#DDFTennis\n|\n@DDFTennis\n@WTA\n@WTA_insider\npic.twitter.com/aGb9bwIHm9\n‚Äî OptaAce (@OptaAce)\nFebruary 22, 2025\nAndreeva‚Äôs backhand caught fire in the second set, and she used that wing to break for 3-1. Tauson continued to battle and earned three break points in the next game, but two excellent serves and another backhand winner on the baseline allowed Andreeva to erase those chances and consolidate for 4-1.\nAndreeva punched an overhead winner to break again for 5-1, and she routinely served out the match to clinch victory. Andreeva had 12 forehand winners and 10 backhand winners in the clash, and she converted four of her seven break points.\n\"I missed some shots that I usually don't miss,\" Andreeva said. \"[But] i\nf something doesn't go your way, OK, fine, you forget about it, play one point at a time.\n\"I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. What he said is it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do today.\"\nScroll to Top\nShare this page\nFacebook\nFacebook\nShare via Facebook\nTwitter\nTwitter\nShare via Twitter\nWhatsApp\nWhatsApp\nShare via WhatsApp\nCopy Link\nCopy Link\nShare via copy\nURL copied"

But it got me thinking‚Ä¶ how often do you see an athlete, in that moment of triumph, turn inward and simply say,\n‚ÄòThank you, me‚Äô\n? It‚Äôs a rare sight, isn‚Äôt it? But that‚Äôs what fans witnessed on Saturday as Mirra Andreeva let her emotions flow and why not? At just 17 years and 299 days, Andreeva made history as the youngest WTA 1000 finalist and champion since 2009. Yet, her post-victory words sparked an unexpected comparison to a speech by Snoop Dogg, delivered seven years prior. What was the surprising link?\nIt was a week full of endless highs for Andreeva at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Before making it to her first WTA 1000 final, the teenager stunned the likes of Marketa Vondrousova, Peyten Sterns, and even former World No.1 Iga Swiatek. Andreeva ousted the five-time Slam queen in straight sets in the QF stage. But she didn‚Äôt stop there and beat another Major winner, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, in the semifinal. On Saturday, Andreeva was probably riding on the form of her life as she didn‚Äôt give her Danish opponent any chance to come back. In straight sets, the 2024 French Open semifinalist sealed her win with a score line of 7-6(1), 6-1.\nAs she hoisted the trophy, Andreeva took her a moment to express her feelings. Delivering a powerful speech, Andreeva said,\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to thank me. I know what I‚Äôve been dealing with so I want to thank me for always believing in me I want to thank me for never quitting and always dealing with the pressure. Today was not easy but I chose to be there 100% so I thank myself for that.‚Äù\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nMirra Andreeva thanks herself after winning Dubai title\n‚ÄúLast but not least, I‚Äôd like to thank me. üòÇ I just want to thank me for always believing in me.‚Äù\nAbsolutely iconic.\npic.twitter.com/Xxks845iby\n‚Äî The Tennis Letter (@TheTennisLetter)\nFebruary 22, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nOf course, it was an emotional moment for her, considering how her season was going a few days ago. After ending her Australian Open run with a fourth round loss to Aryna Sabalenka, she failed to impress in Doha as well. Last week, her campaign wrapped up early with a second round defeat against Rebecca Sramkova. But her courage to prove herself on the court outshined her disappointment.\nIn his 2018 Hollywood Walk of Fame induction speech, American rapper Snoop Dogg (Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.) said,\n‚ÄúI want to thank me for believing in me,‚Äù\nas reported Euro News in November that year. With the initial few words of his speech, he invited a big laughter from the crowd. Maybe people thought he was joking, for thanking himself. But he wasn‚Äôt.\nContinuing further, he said,\n‚ÄúI want to thank me for doing all this hard work. I want to thank me for having no days off. I want to thank me for never quitting. I want to thank me for always being a giver and trying to give more than I receive. I want to thank me for trying to do more right and wrong. I want to thank me for just being me at all times.‚Äù\nRemember his\n‚ÄòI Wanna Thank Me‚Äô\nsong from 2019?\nThe moment tennis fans heard Mirra Andreeva‚Äôs words while accepting her winner‚Äôs trophy in Dubai, some of them went back in time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat‚Äôs your perspective on:\nMirra Andreeva's self-thank you speech: Empowering or egotistical?

Listening to Andreeva, another fan echoed a similar sentiment saying,\n‚ÄúSnoop dog imitation‚Äù.\nFollowing her historic win in Dubai, Andreeva will also accomplish another milestone. For the first time in her career, she will make her top 10 debut in the WTA ranking list. The change will reflect when it gets updated on Monday. From being No.14, she will rise to No.9. Since Czechia‚Äôs Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√° in 2007, she will be the first 17-year-old to be in the top 10.\nWell, well‚Ä¶Andreeva did some ordinary stuff, too. She thanked her team and family, especially her Spanish coach, Conchita Martinez.\n‚ÄúEspecially thanks to Conchita.¬†I know that I can be a pain in the a‚Äì. But you have always been there for me and it feels great to lift this title together. And I hope that we can lift many more trophies together,‚Äù\nshe added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhile the 17-year-old didn‚Äôt even realize it, fans think she unintentionally channelized her inner Snoop Dogg. It becomes evident from another reaction that read,\n‚ÄúThats snoop dog lol‚Äù\nMeanwhile, one user shared the GIF from the rapper‚Äôs speech, as they felt\n‚ÄúSame vibe!‚Äù\nhearing Andreeva. One fan praised her while claiming that had he listened to her,\n‚ÄúSnoop would have been proud‚Äù\ntoo.\nHaving won the WTA 2023 Newcomer of the Year award, Andreeva is only the fifth player to win multiple titles before turning 18. The famous figures to have achieved this feat before her include Maria Sharapova, Micha√´lla Krajicek, Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√°, and\nCoco Gauff\n. Well, what are your thoughts on her victory speech?

Andreeva conceded a break immediately after hitting two consecutive double faults in her opening service game but she fought back and eventually won the set with a dominant performance in the tiebreak.\nWith the first set secured, Andreeva seemed more assured in the second, defending three break points to consolidate her own break at 3-1 and then winning every subsequent game to seal victory.\nDenmark's Tauson was playing in her first WTA 1000 final too.\nChristopher Pike/Getty Images\nSince she is still under 18, there are some parts of the win she can‚Äôt enjoy yet, like sipping on a glass of champagne or having a bank account to accept the $597,000 prize money.\n‚ÄúAll questions to my dad,‚Äù she told reporters when asked how she would spend the prize money,\nper the tournament‚Äôs website\n. ‚ÄúIt all goes on his credit card because I don‚Äôt have my own yet. I cannot have my own bank account because I‚Äôm not 18. I‚Äôm hoping that he will leave me some to spend somewhere, to buy chips and Coke‚Ä¶ Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know what I want.‚Äù\nBy entering the top 10 ‚Äì she will rise from world No. 14 to No. 9 in the new WTA rankings ‚Äì Andreeva said she has already achieved her year‚Äôs goal.

The four-time Major winner keeps her fans updated through social media updates. Remember the outfits she flaunted earlier this week while traveling to California? But she also doesn‚Äôt miss when it comes to interacting with her avid followers in Q&As. And guess what? This time, the former World No.1 ended up teasing them with a mysterious reference regarding her personal life. Interestingly, it involves an anime connection too! What‚Äôs cooking up?\nLet‚Äôs get some context here first. For the uninitiated, Osaka happens to be a huge anime lover. In fact, she even landed her voice for a character last year. The anime series was titled\nAllure: The Evening Primrose,\nbeing produced by her own production company Hana Kuma. Then at the US Open, in August 2024, the Japanese tennis star sported anime vibes through her Nike outfit, representing her cultural roots and Harajuku fashion. Interestingly, her ex-boyfriend and American rapper\nCordae\nwas a die-hard anime lover too. In fact, they used to watch various shows together when they were in a relationship. Last month, Osaka parted ways with him with\n‚ÄúNo bad blood at all‚Äù,\nas she wrote on her Instagram story.\n‚ÄúHonestly really glad our paths crossed because my daughter is my biggest blessing and I was able to grow a lot from our experiences together.‚Äù\nSo Osaka kept a Q&A session on her Instagram on Sunday. As expected, several eager fans asked her intriguing questions. One of them, however, was keen to know whether she was still in contact with Cordae. Although they didn‚Äôt directly reference him, there was a guessing game left for everyone.\n‚ÄúDo you still watch anime with ‚Äòyou know who'‚Äù?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nvia Reuters\nImage Credits: Reuters\nHowever, it was Naomi‚Äôs response that posed even more mystery for her fans. Why so? Giving the answer, she wrote,\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve never watched anime with Voldemort a day in my life. What do you mean???‚Äù\nWell, our question is the same: what exactly did she mean?\nWell, that‚Äôs something only Osaka can clarify in case she comes up with an official update. But when it comes to tennis, there‚Äôs definitely a positive update for her avid fans. She‚Äôs coming back on the court soon. But where?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nNaomi Osaka confirms her comeback WTA event in the 2025 season\nNaomi Osaka\nbegan her journey on a positive note this season. At the ASB Classic, she reached the final battle but couldn‚Äôt lift the trophy. Her abdominal injury forced her to withdraw from the championship match despite the fact that she was leading 6-4 against her opponent Clara Tauson. Then at the Australian Open, the same issue resurfaced.\nIn the third round against Belinda Bencic, Osaka decided to pull herself out of the court because of the abdominal strain. It‚Äôs been over a month since she was last seen in action. But the wait is going to get over next month ‚Äì finally!

(Photo by Kelly Defina/Getty Images)\nNick Kyrgios\nhas made quite a reputation for himself with his unfiltered opinions. The Aussie doesn‚Äôt shy away from having a go at the current or ex-pros, at the slightest of provocations. After relentlessly targeting Jannik Sinner for the failed dope tests at Indian Wells, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist recently labeled Boris Becker a ‚Äòcriminal‚Äô without hesitation. And for what? Well, Becker commented\n‚Äòlol‚Äô o\nn an X post that was trolling Kyrgios. His tendency to say things unfiltered has turned the Aussie into one of the most controversial figures in the sport. But that‚Äôs not his entire personality. Away from the spotlight, Kyrgios is a different person, as his Instagram followers found out recently.\nKyrgios returned to the court this season with the Brisbane International, almost one and half years after his last tour-level performance at the 2023 Stuttgart Open. While his career-threatening knee and wrist injury sidelined him from many tournaments, he was thoughtful about the timing of his comeback. However, the 2018 Brisbane champion encountered bad luck in the tournament this time around, losing against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round. His doubles run with Djokovic also ended in sheer disappointment as the charismatic pair lost in the second round against the top seeds Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus.\nKyrgios next participated in the Australian Open but lost in the opening round there as well, to Jacob Fearnley.¬† Despite these setbacks and fitness concerns, Kyrgios is determined to regain his old form, one that helped him overpower Roger Federer in the 2015 Madrid Open‚Äôs R32. But away from the scene, he is enjoying some wholesome moments.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe Aussie ATP star shared his girlfriend Costeen Hatzi‚Äôs IG story\nthat featured him and his adorable dachshund puppy named Boo. The story had Kyrgios hitting shots in a practice session as his dog watched him closely, not losing sight of the ball, even for a moment. ‚Äú\nBoo watching,‚Äù\ncaptioned Hatzi tagging Kyrgios, who couldn‚Äôt help but acknowledge his dog‚Äôs love for him.\nFor those unversed, Boo often appears in Hatzi‚Äôs Instagram stories, with all the cuteness in the world. He was adopted by the couple in August 2023 and ever since, he has been indispensable to the family. Kyrgios‚Äô social media influencer girlfriend shared an adorable moment with Boo last month, where the dog slept peacefully on her lap. ‚Äú\nHas to always be half on me and half on Nick,‚Äù\nshe wrote highlighting the comfort their dog shares with them.\nBefore Boo, Kyrgios has two other dogs ‚Äî Quincy and King, who share a deep bond with the ATP star, bringing balance to his hectic life.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat‚Äôs your perspective on:\nIs Nick Kyrgios a misunderstood genius or just a troublemaker with a soft spot for dogs?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nNick Kyrgios‚Äô dogs remind him of ‚Äú\nlife‚Äôs simple pleasures‚Äù\nNick Kyrgios reflected on the importance of his dogs\nin his life in an interview with the Health Hacker in 2021. ‚Äú\nI have two at home, Quincy and King. They always give me a smile and make me realize how important the simple things are in life,‚Äù\nhe revealed.\nLike Boo, Quincy is an adorable dachshund and King is a golden retriever. Earlier they stayed with Kyrgios in his Canberra home, the dogs later moved in with his family when the ATP star started living with his girlfriend in Sydney. In 2023, Kyrgios shared a picture with Quincy with an adorable message: ‚Äú\nMiss you.‚Äù\nHis words carried his deep affection for his old companion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nFor Kyrgios, his dogs aren‚Äôt just his pets but his family. When he played his 2022 Wimbledon, his mother Nill Kyrgios stayed in her son‚Äôs Canberra home, looking after Quincy and King.\nKyrgios‚Äô love for his pet showcases an unexplored side of his personality. Yet, he is widely known for his unfiltered opinions which, at times, are harsh as well. Which side of his personality do you like?

So I think he‚Äôs very comfortable in himself,‚Äù Singer told BBC Sport.\nMore Tennis News\n‚ÄúHe keeps off social media where there are an awful lot of people with a platform, and who don‚Äôt necessarily know the facts of the case, or investigate the facts of the case as much as they might do.‚Äù\nPhoto by Tullio Puglia/Getty Images\nHow will Jannik Sinner be received by the fans after his ban has ended?\nSinner‚Äôs suspension ends on May 4, and the Italian Open is set to commence just three days later on May 7.\nSinner missed the tournament in 2024 due to injury, and he is likely to receive a raucous reception with thunderous cheers should he make an appearance at the Foro Italico.\nItalian journalist Daniele Verri told BBC Sport: ‚ÄúMost tennis fans here think the ban is absurd and are still supporting him. ‚ÄòSinner-mania‚Äô has not wavered.‚Äù\nAccording to Wada rules, Sinner will be allowed to resume ‚Äòofficial training activity‚Äô, three weeks before his ban is set to end.\nATP\nJannik Sinner"

                "Claro ATP 500 Rio Open 2025 | Buda Mendes/GettyImages\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nShare on Reddit\nCopy Article\nNo other players on the ATP tour have any chance of catching Jannik Sinner as ATP No. 1 during the\nItalian's suspension for failed drug tests\nin March of 2024 than Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz. To have any chance of getting close to Sinner's ranking, though, both Zverev and Alcaraz need to take advantage of all the chances they have in the next few months.\nThis week, the German and Spaniard failed to do much in the way of helping themselves. Both played in 500 events that they should have been expected to win (if there is no Sinner, Zverev and Alcaraz should be the favorites at any tournaments they are playing apart from one another), but neither made it past the quarterfinals. Zverev's loss might have been the most shocking.\nPlaying on clay, perhaps Zverev's best surface, at the Rio Open (a tournament he appeared to choose to play in because it gave him the best chance to make up points on Sinner), the German lost to ATP No. 86 Francisco Comesana.\nJannik Sinner has a successful week because of Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz's failures\nThe Argentine has never won an ATP title, and his career record entering the tournament was 4-10. Even if he goes on to win in Rio after defeating Zverev, he would still have a career-losing record.\nIn\nthe live ATP rankings\n, Zverev did not lose any points, but that is part of the issue. The German began the Rio event nearly 3,200 points behind Sinner. There is little time for failure, and he should have been able to take full advantage against a fairly weak field in the tournament.\nAlcaraz's field was much tougher at the Qatar Open, and\nhis loss to Jiri Lehecka\nshould bear no shame. Lehecka is a good young player, but he is not as good as the Spaniard. The fact that Lehecka lost his next match in the Qatar semifinals might make the loss sting a bit more for Alcaraz. He did pick up 100 points during the event, but he could have done so much better.\nThe fact appears to be that neither Alcaraz nor Zverev are going to be in any position to reach Sinner before the Italian returns in early May. The real battle will likely be for ATP No. 2 where the Spaniard trails the German by 625 points. Sinner's lead is so big that there is almost as much of a difference between him and Zverev as there is between Zverev and ATP No. 4 Taylor Fritz.\nMore tennis news and analysis:\nHome\n/\nTennis News"

                "Novak Djokovic in action\nIt has been revealed where Novak Djokovic will play next ‚Äì and the tennis great is set to stick to his intended tournament schedule despite concerns over his fitness.\nThe Serbian‚Äôs participation at the Indian Wells Masters has been confirmed, with the tournament‚Äôs social media account posting a picture of Djokovic with the following caption: ‚ÄúA legend returns to the desert.‚Äù\nIndian Wells, which is the first¬†ATP Masters 1000 event of the season, will be held from March 5 to 16.\nDjokovic\nsuffered a tear in his left hamstring during his four-set win against Carlos Alcaraz at the Australian Open last month.\nThe injury forced Djokovic to retire after the first set of his semi-final with Alexander Zverev in Melbourne, but he made a swift recovery to return to action for this week‚Äôs Qatar Open.\nThe 37-year-old was beaten 7-6(4), 6-2 by Matteo Berrettini in the first round of the ATP 500 tournament and insisted afterwards that he felt fine physically.\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have any pain or discomfort in that sense. I was outplayed by just a better player today,‚Äù Djokovic told reporters in Doha.\n‚ÄúYes, I wasn‚Äôt at my desired level, and it could be that I‚Äôm still not moving the way I want to move, but, I mean, I played without pain, so there is no excuse in that.\nNovak Djokovic News\nFresh fears over Novak Djokovic‚Äôs injury after worrying video emerges\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs fairly straightforward that Novak Djokovic is the greatest male player of all time‚Äô\n‚ÄúHe was just the better player. I think he played a masterclass match, to be honest, tactically, and served very well, so just a very deserved win from his side.‚Äù\nDjokovic also played two matches in the Qatar Open doubles event as he reached the quarter-finals with Fernando Verdasco at the Spaniard‚Äôs last-ever event.\nDespite Djokovic‚Äôs assertion that he played without pain, a video emerged of him appearing to limp as he entered an airport to depart from Doha.\nThis raised some fears that the world No 7 could have made his comeback from the hamstring tear too soon and suffered a recurrence, or that a different injury had surfaced.\nThe 24-time Grand Slam winner‚Äôs commitment to play in Indian Wells, though, suggests he is not worried about his physical state.\nDjokovic has revealed he is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to resume his player-coach collaboration with Andy Murray in Indian Wells after a hugely positive start to the relationship at the Australian Open.\nThe Serbian suffered a shock defeat to Luca Nardi in the third round of the 2024 Indian Wells Masters. That was his first appearance at the tournament in the Californian desert since 2019.\nDjokovic is a five-time Indian Wells champion.\nREAD NEXT:\nNovak Djokovic makes ‚Äòmore challenging‚Äô confession as he addresses suffering ‚Äòmore injuries‚Äô"

But what if your mom is a five-time Grand Slam champion and a former World No. 1? That‚Äôs the case for Theodore, the son of Russian tennis star\nMaria Sharapova\nand her fianc√©, Alexander Gilkes. The couple, who started dating in 2018 and announced their engagement in December 2020, welcomed their son on July 1, 2022. Fans have gotten occasional glimpses of their life through social media. But while some might expect Theodore to inherit his mom‚Äôs love for tennis, it turns out the two-year-old has other ideas.\nOn Saturday, February 22, Sharapova shared a series of\nInstagram Stories\ndocumenting Theodore‚Äôs brief attempt at the sport. Let‚Äôs just say his interest didn‚Äôt last long. ‚Äú\nIt lasted less than a minuteüòÇ,\n‚Äù she captioned the post. With her son completely uninterested, the former World No.1 had no choice but to keep playing on her own.‚Äú\nI guess I‚Äôll just play myself,‚Äù\nshe joked.\nIt‚Äôs a funny twist, considering how much tennis has shaped her life. And last year, she had the chance to relive some of her most iconic moments at the place where it all started.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nMaria Sharapova took the tennis world by storm when she won her first Grand Slam at just 17, defeating Serena Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final. Fast forward two decades, and she returned to the All England Club‚Äîthis time, not as a competitor but as a former champion with her fianc√©, Alexander Gilkes, and their son, Theodore, by her side.\nSharapova took a moment to show Theodore her name on the list of champions, a piece of history that might mean more to him someday. For now, though, he seemed more interested in everything else happening around him. The toddler was spotted waving at ball kids as they passed by, soaking in the atmosphere of one of tennis‚Äô most famous venues. He even had the chance to watch reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz practice on an outside court‚Äîa moment most tennis fans would dream of.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Maria Sharapova (@mariasharapova)\nDespite being surrounded by tennis history, Theodore doesn‚Äôt seem too interested in following in his mom‚Äôs footsteps.

While she acknowledges that raising a child is a ‚Äúfull-time job,‚Äù she also finds immense joy in watching ‚Äúthis little human grow‚Äù and express himself.\nIn June, the former World No. 1 opened up to PEOPLE about how her tennis career unexpectedly prepared her for motherhood.‚Äú\nI think in some ways there were so many elements of my sport that I could apply into motherhood,\n‚Äù she said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe 5-time Grand Slam champion explained that the discipline and structure she followed throughout her career have played a big role in how she approaches parenting. The 37-year-old added, ‚Äú\nJust the discipline of the schedules and routines and seeing the benefit of that through their behavior and through their eyes has also been really helpful. When I was playing, knowing where I was going to be and when I was going to nap and when I was going to eat helped me so much with my energy.‚Äù\nMaria Sharapova may no longer be competing on the court, but in this new chapter of her life, she‚Äôs winning in a different way.

                "SHARE\n¬© Rio Open/Instagram - Fair Use\nAlexander Zverev made some harsh comments about the balls used at the Rio Open just before suffering a shock loss.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Friday, the top seed saw his campaign end in the quarterfinal after world No. 86 Francisco Comesana completed an upset 4-6 6-3 6-4 win.\nBut even before exiting the tournament, the world No. 2 struggled - he overcame Bu Yunchaokete 7-6 (4) 6-4 before edging out Alexander Shevchenko 7-6 (1) 7-6 (6) in the round-of-16.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve had some difficulties with the balls here, the Wilson balls tend to be flat, which isn‚Äôt good for my elbow,‚Äù Zverev said after beating Shevchenko in two tight sets.\n‚ÄúThis is another issue that players have been talking about a lot over the last year, two years, a lot.‚Äù\nAfter these comments, the German struggles continued against Comesana and it all resulted in him ending his run earlier than expected.\nWhat Zverev said about Rio de Janeiro after the shock loss?\nAlthough the 27-year-old's debut at the Rio Open didn't go as planned and he criticized the balls, he actually spoke positively about the tournament after the Comesana loss.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLast week, the world No. 2 played in Buenos Aires, where he was upset by Francisco Cerundolo in the quarterfinal.\n\"Better level than Buenos Aires but unfortunate to finish the tournament like this,\" Zverev said after his Rio Open exit.\n\"I still enjoyed my time in Rio and hope to come back. It's one of the most beautiful 500s that I've ever played. Shame because I was in a winning position.\"\nNow, the three-time Grand Slam finalist will return to hard and start preparing for the Indian Wells Masters.\nSo far this year, the 27-year-old has been playing pretty well on hard as he is 8-1 on the surface - he won both of his United Cup matches and also made the Australian Open final before losing to Jannik Sinner.\nAlexander Zverev\nRio Open\nFrancisco Comesana\nSHARE"
