The conductor has been booked under the POCSO Act.\n“Conductor Mahadev Hukkeri has been serving on the same route for over five years. He was beaten up a group of men in the village over a language row. The charge that he molested a minor girl on the bus is false and baseless. There were 90 passengers in the bus. How is such an offence possible in such a situation in broad daylight? Vested interests have filed the case against him only to harass him. It is unfortunate that the police have registered the complaint. They should have used their common sense before registering the First Information Report,” Mr Reddy said.\nHe was speaking to reporters after meeting the injured conductor in the hospital.\nKarnataka Conductor allegedly assaulted for asking commuter to speak in Kannada\nA group of unidentified miscreants allegedly assaulted a NWKRTC conductor for asking them to speak in Kannada as he did not know Marathi in Chikka Balekundri village of Belagavi district on February 22.\n| Video Credit:\nThe Hindu\nHe said that officers had told him that the conductor had got into an altercation with a boy and girl, both minors, who refused to speak Kannada. The conductor found out that the boy was a ticketless traveller. He had obtained, against rules, a zero fare ticket, from another female passenger. When the conductor questioned this, they asked him to speak in Marathi. He asked them to speak in Kannada. An argument ensued. The boy called his friends and family members on his mobile phone. They got into the bus at the next bus stop and allegedly assaulted the conductor, the Minister said.\nThe conductor is worried about the POCSO case. “KSRTC and other State-run transport undertakings operate 1.72 lakh trips per day. We have been operating for nearly seven decades, but this is the first such case against any of our staff,” the Minister said.\n“The doctors told me the conductor would be discharged after two days. NWKRTC MD and other senior officers have visited the hospital and met his family. They have also spoken to the police. I will speak to the Home minster and see that no innocent is punished,” Mr Reddy said.\nDCP Rohan Jagadeesh meets Mahadev Hukkeri, a NWKRTC conductor allegedly assaulted in Chikka Balekundri village in Belagavi district, on February 21, 2025.\n| Photo Credit:\nBadiger P. K.\nFour of the five persons, who have been arrested, have been remanded in judicial custody. One is a minor.\nMinister of Women and Child Development Laxmi Hebbalkar, in whose constituency the village lies, condemned the attack on the conductor. “We should not fight on language issues. We should live like brothers and sisters,” she said.\n“It is true that Belagavi Rural constituency is a Marathi speaking area. But it is also true that they have voted for me, a Kannadiga. It proves that the common people have no language based ill-will. Only a few miscreants are creating problems based on language. Within five minutes of the incident, I spoke to the police commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, and asked them to take action against the attackers. I was keeping track of the incident. But the police registered a POCSO case against the conductor at midnight, without my knowledge. They should have thought about it properly. What to do?” she told reporters at her home.\nMr Reddy had gone to meet Ms. Hebbalkar, who is recuperating after a\nroad accident\n.\nKannada Chaluvali leader Gurudev Narayan Kumar has accused Ms. Hebbalkar of exerting undue influence on the Belagavi police to lodge an FIR under POCSO Act against the conductor. He led a delegation to meet Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru on February 24, and complained that the Minister had forced the police to file a counter-complaint to protect her Marathi vote bank.\nMr Kumar also alleged that Belagavi Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Roshan had given an assurance to Marathi groups to issue copies of government documents in Marathi, and sought action against him.\nPublished\n- February 24, 2025 03:22 pm IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated stories\nBelagavi row: Won't tolerate insult to Kannada and Karnataka, says BJP's Vijayendra\nKarnataka-Maharashtra border remains tense as language row escalates; Ramalinga Reddy to visit Belagavi today\nKannada activists oppose demand for issuing govt. documents in Marathi\nOne more accused arrested for assault on NWKRTC bus conductor in Belagavi\nBus service between Maharashtra-Karnataka suspended in light of assault on State Transport employee\nAssault on NWKRTC bus conductor leads to suspension of some bus services; four held\nConductor allegedly assaulted for asking commuter to speak in Kannada\nRelated Topics\nKarnataka\n/\npublic transport\n/\nMaharashtra\n/\nBelgaum\n/\nKannada\n/\nlanguage\nTop News Today\n0\n/\n0\nRead in App\nSign in to unlock member-only benefits!\nAccess 10 free stories every month\nSave stories to read later\nAccess to comment on every story\nSign-up/manage your newsletter subscriptions with a single click\nGet notified by email for early access to discounts & offers on our products\n✕\nLooks like you are already logged in from more than 3 devices!\nTo continue logging in, remove at least one device from the below list\nLog out\nLog Out from all devices\nTerms & conditions\n|\nInstitutional Subscriber\nComments\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.
