Dans un document officiel adress\u00e9 au Minist\u00e8re des Sports et de l\u2019\u00c9ducation Physique (Minsep) , la Fecafoot a list\u00e9 18 griefs \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du technicien belge, accus\u00e9 de multiples manquements. Cette crise, qui dure depuis des mois, menace la stabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9quipe nationale \u00e0 l\u2019approche des \u00e9liminatoires de la Coupe du monde 2026 . Parmi les accusations port\u00e9es contre Marc Brys, la Fecafoot d\u00e9nonce un refus de collaboration avec l\u2019instance dirigeante. Le s\u00e9lectionneur est notamment accus\u00e9 d\u2019avoir manqu\u00e9 des r\u00e9unions importantes, de ne pas avoir transmis les rapports et les listes de joueurs conform\u00e9ment aux exigences, et d\u2019avoir ignor\u00e9 les directives de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Ces manquements auraient mis en p\u00e9ril les accords avec les sponsors , violant ainsi la charte marketing de la Fecafoot. En outre, Marc Brys est critiqu\u00e9 pour son m\u00e9pris des instances dirigeantes . Il aurait refus\u00e9 de travailler avec des adjoints impos\u00e9s par la Fecafoot et tenu des d\u00e9clarations jug\u00e9es irrespectueuses dans les m\u00e9dias. Des incidents protocolaires, dont un pr\u00e9tendu manque de respect \u00e0 l\u2019 hymne national lors d\u2019un match contre le Zimbabwe, ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9s. Face \u00e0 ces accusations, la Fecafoot demande au Minsep d\u2019intervenir pour rappeler le s\u00e9lectionneur \u00e0 l\u2019ordre, sous peine de mesures drastiques si son comportement ne s\u2019am\u00e9liore pas avant le 14 mars 2025 . Cependant, le clan Brys a rapidement r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9, remettant en cause la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de ces accusations. Ivo Chi , l\u2019agent du s\u00e9lectionneur, a soulign\u00e9 que la Fecafoot n\u2019est pas l\u2019employeur de Marc Brys. Selon lui, le contrat du technicien belge a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9 directement avec le Minsep, et la Fecafoot n\u2019y est pas mentionn\u00e9e comme partie prenante. Pour le clan Brys, la Fecafoot outrepasse donc ses pr\u00e9rogatives en exigeant une soumission totale du coach. Cette crise institutionnelle intervient \u00e0 un moment crucial pour les Lions Indomptables, qui doivent se pr\u00e9parer pour les \u00e9liminatoires de la Coupe du monde 2026. Les tensions persistantes entre la Fecafoot et le Minsep, ainsi que les relations tendues entre Samuel Eto'o, pr\u00e9sident de la Fecafoot, et le gouvernement, compliquent encore la situation. En conclusion, cette guerre ouverte entre la Fecafoot et Marc Brys menace non seulement la stabilit\u00e9 des Lions Indomptables, mais aussi les performances de l\u2019\u00e9quipe nationale sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale. La r\u00e9solution de ce conflit sera d\u00e9terminante pour l\u2019avenir du football camerounais. #Fecafoot #MarcBrys #LionsIndomptables #Minsep #CoupeDuMonde2026 #FootballCamerounais #Crise Lire aussi dans la rubrique SPORT Les + r\u00e9cents 13:17 Mouvement de F\u00e9vrier 2008 au Cameroun:21 f\u00e9vrier 2014 -21 f\u00e9vrier 2025, Remember Charles ATEBA EYENE 12:21 Crash du Boeing 737 de Camair en 1995 : Proc\u00e8s, responsabilit\u00e9s et r\u00e9clamations de 103 milliards de 12:07 Affaire Nkap \u00e0 Maroua : Deux amantes d'un fonctionnaire le tabassent pour dissimulation de salaire 11:26 Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de la Fecafoot contre Marc Brys : Un Bras de Fer Inutile 11:23 Yunus SA et la Jeunesse Camerounaise, ont f\u00eat\u00e9 le 11 F\u00e9vrier SPORT :: les + lus Le camerounais Samuel Eto\u2019o et trois nig\u00e9rians parmi les dix footballeurs les plus riches d\u2019Afrique 23 December 2015 / 210448 Acad\u00e9mie nationale de football : Au travail ! 06 June 2017 / 123284 Samuel Eto\u2019o rach\u00e8te, r\u00e9nove et offre l\u2019Ambassade du Cameroun \u00e0 Washington 27 October 2015 / 120146 Samuel Eto\u2019o bat un record et obtient 40 millions d\u2019Euros 02 December 2015 / 117349 C'\u00e9tait En Direct sur Camer.be Cameroun 5 vs S\u00e9n\u00e9gal 4 : le Cameroun en 1/2 finale 28 January 2017 / 109946 LE D\u00e9BAT Afrique -D\u00e9bat: Pourquoi la crise anglophone persiste au Cameroun? 24 June 2018 / 207694 Divorces dans la diaspora camerounaise en Europe : explications ? 17 June 2018 / 200396 Quand est-ce les Camerounais prendront enfin leurs responsabilit\u00e9s pour la gestion de leur \u00e9quipe? 05 August 2018 / 194251 Afrique : Quel droit \u00e0 l&#39;image pour les d\u00e9funts au Cameroun ? 17 December 2017 / 190926 Canada - Cameroun, Libert\u00e9 de manifestation partisane au Cameroun : Encore une incurie liberticide de Biya Paul ? 22 October 2017 / 187563 POINT DU DROIT La probl\u00e9matique du changement de nom en droit compar\u00e9 20 April 2019 / 191088 Les \u00e9tapes et les frais de proc\u00e9dure du morcellement d&#39;un terrain au Cameroun 18 June 2016 / 131424 L'obtention d'un titre foncier au Cameroun \u00e0 l'issue d'une vente de terrain 26 October 2019 / 125173 Le jugement suppl\u00e9tif de rectification d'acte de naissance au Cameroun 15 June 2019 / 120297 La proc\u00e9dure d'achat d'un terrain titr\u00e9 dans la ville de Yaound\u00e9 04 May 2019 / 118936 partenaire Vid\u00e9o de la semaine \u00e9v\u00e8nement Vid\u00e9o L'actualit\u00e9 en vid\u00e9o il y a une semaine Monny Eka, artiste de Petit Pays et membre des Sans-Visas, n\u2019est plus : d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 Douala 14 Feb 2025 / 4397 Une Camerounaise de 33 ans tu\u00e9e en Suisse : 12 balles pour un crime familial li\u00e9 au racisme 14 Feb 2025 / 3015 Cabral Libii \u00e9chappe \u00e0 un accident en pleine tourn\u00e9e dans l\u2019Adamaoua 14 Feb 2025 / 2327 D\u00e9c\u00e8s de Wawa Moluh Mekou Th\u00e9odore, architecte et homme politique \u00e0 Foumban 14 Feb 2025 / 2131 Paul Biya et Samuel Tony Obam Bikou\u00e9 : Une Reconnaissance Controvers\u00e9e 14 Feb 2025 / 2121 il y a un mois Merhoye Laoumaye : voici l\u2019homme et voil\u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre 21 Jan 2025 / 4486 France-Cameroun : Des travaux remis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e sur une histoire commune (1945-1971) 21 Jan 2025 / 2632 560 millions FCFA de subvention \u00e9tatique pour les clubs de football professionnels 21 Jan 2025 / 2391 Le Conseil Constitutionnel rend une d\u00e9cision controvers\u00e9e dans l'affaire MRC contre ELECAM 21 Jan 2025 / 1989 Fon de Koshin \"Aucun Fon de la r\u00e9gion du Nord-Ouest ne contr\u00f4le un autre village de Fons\" 21 Jan 2025 / 1968 il y a un an Gr\u00e9goire Mbida Arantes, une l\u00e9gende du football camerounais, dans un \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 pr\u00e9occupant 21 Feb 2024 / 5946 Scandale financier \u00e0 la FECAFOOT : Surfactions et Favoritisme Mis en Lumi\u00e8re 21 Feb 2024 / 4139 Entendu 21 Feb 2024 / 3877 Le MRC d\u00e9ment les propos tenus par Henriette Ekw\u00e9 sur Info TV 21 Feb 2024 / 3868 CONDOLEANCES FRATRERNELLES, SINCERE COMPASSION ET SOUTIEN MORAL A LA FAMILLE ATANGANA KOUNA 21 Feb 2024 / 3116 \u00a9 2005 - 2025 Camer.be"

(Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON and Thomas COEX / AFP) Agency Report Kindly share this story: Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... A Spanish court on Thursday convicted former football chief Luis Rubiales of sexual assault over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso, fining him \u20ac10,800 ($11,300). However, the court acquitted him and three other accused individuals of coercion charges. Prosecutors had sought a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence for Rubiales \u2014 one year for sexual assault and 18 months for coercion \u2014 alleging he pressured Hermoso to downplay the incident. Rubiales was accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso in 2023 following Spain\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup triumph in Australia, as well as coercion for allegedly trying to persuade her to dismiss the significance of the incident. The global outcry over the kiss forced Rubiales to resign in disgrace, drawing attention to the prevalence of macho culture and sexism in sports. Hermoso, 34, testified on the opening day of the trial on 3 February, saying she felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d after a non-consensual kiss that \u201cshould not happen in any social or workplace setting.\u201d However, Rubiales, 47, told the court on Tuesday that he was \u201ctotally sure\u201d Hermoso had consented to the kiss as she stepped up to receive her winner\u2019s medal. He denied pressuring her after the incident, which was broadcast live worldwide. Related News Rubiales forced kiss: Hermoso will appeal verdict - Lawyer Spain ex-football chief's kiss shouldn't happen in any setting - Hermoso Spain's ex-football chief's trial over unsolicited kiss begins Monday He admitted he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d on the podium, saying he should have \u201cadopted a more formal role,\u201d but insisted no offence had been committed. Rubiales\u2019 court testimony contrasted sharply with the defiance he showed when the scandal first broke. During an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, he dismissed the importance of the kiss, resisted calls for his resignation, and denounced \u201cfalse feminism.\u201d Rubiales eventually resigned in September 2023 after FIFA suspended him and Spanish prosecutors launched an investigation into alleged sexual assault. He had been president of the federation since 2018. Hermoso, the all-time top scorer for Spain\u2019s women\u2019s team, now plays for Mexican club Tigres. She was not immediately called up to the national squad after the World Cup, but new coach Montse Tom\u00e9 insisted the omission was \u201cto protect\u201d her rather than as \u201cpunishment.\u201d AFP Kindly share this story: All rights reserved.

He embraces the challenge of helping the Elks return to the CFL playoffs. Elks last made playoffs in 2019 Dan Ralph \u00b7 The Canadian Press \u00b7 Posted: Feb 20, 2025 9:00 AM EST | Last Updated: February 20 The Edmonton Elks have added a list of new players to the roster since CFL free agency started. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Emmanuel Rugamba embraces the challenge of helping the Edmonton Elks return to the CFL playoffs. The veteran linebacker/defensive back was part of Edmonton general manager Ed Hervey's deep dive into CFL free agency earlier this month. Rugamba was among several veterans Hervey, in his second tenure with the Elks, added to his roster, including: defensive backs Royce Metchie and Tyrell Ford, defensive linemen Robbie Smith, Jake Ceresna, Jared Brinkman and Brandon Barlow, punter Cody Grace and receiver Steven Dunbar. This followed Canadian quarterback Tre Ford \u2014 Tyrell's twin brother \u2014 and linebacker Nyles Morgan being among those who signed extensions. Edmonton (7-11) was fourth in the West Division this season and last made the playoffs in 2019. \"Pressure is a privilege,\" said Rugamba, who spent the last three seasons with the B.C. Lions. \"Being a part of the Edmonton Elks is a privilege and that includes whatever pressure that might come with it. \"That fan base is electric and I want to go out there and give them my best. The pressure is something I look forward to.\" Elks hire longtime Stampeders assistant Mark Kilam to be head coach The five-foot-11, 194-pound Rugamba registered 73 tackles, one special-teams tackle, one sack and an interception in 16 regular-season games last year with B.C. The '23 West Division all-star appeared in 44 regular-season contests with the Lions, recording 169 tackles, 10 special-teams tackles, four sacks and two interceptions. \"Emmanuel is a highly motivated, intelligent and well-rounded person,\" said Kenny Kim of Summit Athletes, Rugamba's Florida-based agent. \"He got to experience free agency this off-season and made a business decision to sign with the team that will best showcase his skillset. \"I have full confidence he'll again be one of the top defensive players in the league.\" Rugamba, 26, joined B.C. after making NFL history in 2021. He signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent, becoming the first player of Rwandan descent to join a league team. LISTEN | Edmonton Elks moves: Radio Active 8:20 Edmonton Elks moves The Edmonton Elks did not hold back hold back this weekend getting as many as nine players added to the roster. Vice president of football operations and general manager Ed Hervey has made no secret that heading into next season, the team needed a shakeup. \"I definitely think about that,\" Rugamba said. \"It just goes to show you've got to be grateful for every opportunity you get. \"Just the feedback I got from that and continue to get to this day, it's something I take tremendous pride in. I'm definitely playing for more than myself every time I put the pads on.\" An opportunity that came from very humble beginnings. Rugamba was born in a refugee camp in Zambia to Rwandan parents. His family had been displaced by the Rwandan civil war and spent two years in the camp before emigrating to Chicago. Rugamba is the youngest of 11 children (brothers, sisters and cousins) his mother, Daniella Umutanguha, raised on her own in the United States. She worked to support the family while also putting herself through school to be a nurse. Emmanuel Rugamba, shown here as a B.C. Lions player during a game last year, recently signed with the Edmonton Elks. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) \"My mom really is incredible,\" Rugamba said. \"She could barely speak English when she was going to school. \"It's definitely something I always think about in regards to what I'm doing for a living now, being able to live out my dream. It's something I try to grasp every chance I get.\" Rugamba began playing football at age nine, eventually earning a scholarship to Iowa. He later transferred to Miami (Ohio). \"It wasn't until I got to high school that I understood you could go to college for free just playing sports,\" he said. \"I remember being very grateful getting my first scholarship when I was 16 and seeing the smile on my mom's face knowing she didn't have to pay for school.\" Rugamba admits his memories of the family's time in the refugee camp are limited, given his age at the time. Winnipeg Blue Bombers sign pair of receivers as CFL free agency kicks off \"There are definitely pictures from that time and we've talked as a family and shared experiences about what life was like there,\" Rugamba said. \"But everything I remember and we speak about, even though it was definitely a traumatic time we only saw it in a positive light regarding just how strong family can be. \"Even when you look at the pictures from back then, people are smiling and those smiles are still the same smiles we see today. I'll never, ever forget the opportunity I have here now.\" And includes trying to win a first Grey Cup as a player and earn Edmonton's its first championship since 2015. \"Man, it's the pinnacle of this league,\" Rugamba said. \"It doesn't matter what you do out there, what your stats are, at the end of the year you want to be the team holding that trophy over your head. \"I guarantee you'd substitute whatever stat you have to in order to get a ring in return. Like I say, pressure is a privilege and I'm going to continue to run towards that in every aspect of my career.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices | About CBC News Corrections and clarifications | Submit a news tip | Report error Related Stories CFL free-agency window set to officially open Sunday at noon ET Winnipeg Blue Bombers sign pair of receivers as CFL free agency kicks off New fire chief aims to tackle Edmonton's big problems amid increased calls for help Canadian RB Chuba Hubbard optimistic better times lie ahead for NFL's Panthers It's 'every kid's dream,' says first Super Bowl player from London, Ont.

Cryptocurrency investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss inject \u00a33.58m and become part-owners The Winklevoss brothers have injected \u00a33.58m ($4.5m) into eighth-tier Real Bedford FC, continuing a trend for heavy investment in non-League clubs, with Wrexham and Salford City having already risen to League One and League Two respectively Nick Wright Comment and Analysis @nicholaspwright Thursday 20 February 2025 14:49, UK Image: Tyler Winklevoss, left, and Cameron Winklevoss have invested in Real Bedford FC American cryptocurrency moguls Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have finalised a \u00a33.58m ($4.5m) investment in eighth-tier club Real Bedford FC, Sky Sports News can reveal. The deal sees the Winklevoss brothers, who founded cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and have a net worth of \u00a32.14bn ($2.7bn), take a 45 per cent stake in the club and become co-owners. A deal in principle for their investment was reached and announced in April 2024 but final investment documents were only signed on Wednesday after full terms were agreed. Sky Sports News understands the investment is in cash, not the cryptocurrency bitcoin, contrary to reports last year. The Winklevoss twins, 43, will play an active role in Real Bedford's growth alongside chair Peter McCormack, a cryptocurrency podcaster who bought the club in 2021. Away from business, the twins are also known for having competed for the USA in the men's pair rowing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The story of their long-running legal dispute with Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg was depicted in the 2010 film The Social Network. In 2011, the brothers' claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea while classmates at Harvard University was dismissed in court as a judge ordered them to accept a cash and stock settlement in the platform.

Live football on Sky Sports this week Their long-term aim with Real Bedford is to reach the Premier League and their investment follows the success of Hollywood duo Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds, who have fuelled Wrexham's rise from the National League to League One since buying the club in 2021. Salford City are another example of a club to have benefitted from high-profile investment having risen from the seventh tier to League Two following a takeover by former Manchester United players including Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes in 2014. The process of rising through the leagues has already begun for Real Bedford under McCormack. Their men's team sit top of the Southern League Division One Central having achieved back-to-back promotions in the last two years. The women's team, Real Bedford Ladies, are also top of their division and on course for promotion to the third tier of women's football. Cameron Winklevoss explained their motivation for investing in the club on social media platform X last year, writing: \"We believe that Real Bedford has the ability to defy the odds, upset the establishment and dethrone incumbents. \"We love underdog stories that have the ability to literally change the game.\" Rob Hepburn, a corporate lawyer at Simons Muirhead Burton who advised the Winklevoss' on their investment, told Sky Sports News: \"It's a really exciting time for the lower leagues of football in England. \"We've seen the success that Salford City and Wrexham have had with big injections of cash and Real Bedford look set to continue the trend. \"The deal illustrates again the appeal of English football to investors, particularly where there is a media angle to it. \"While a deal in principle was announced back in April 2024, full terms were only recently agreed largely because of the level of active involvement Cameron and Tyler want to have in the club. \"They intend to be hands-on alongside co-owner Peter McCormack, who already has made huge strides with the club and with whom the brothers have formed a great working relationship.\" Real Bedford also recently announced a proposed merger with Bedford Town FC, who play in the Southern League Premier Division Central in the seventh tier.

Yet, under the lights, I fancy the Foxes. I saw aspects against us that they can build on. They need the points more. Everton 1-0 Man United The biggest compliment you can give David Moyes is that there is a feel-good factor at Goodison Park for the first time in a while. Moyes has created that a lot quicker than even he would have imagined. He hasn\u2019t just been conservative and organised either. Ruben Amorim\u2019s win/loss percentage is already being compared to those before him, so losing to David Moyes isn\u2019t going to help his cause. Arsenal 1-0 West Ham If we are going to put together the winning sequence needed to catch the league leaders, it will be down to our defence. At the King Power, it wasn\u2019t exciting to watch, and we had to be patient. If we want even an outside chance of being champions, Gooners have to accept that\u2019s how we must play until the end of the season. We haven\u2019t got the attacking options to be the free-flowing team we want to be. The Emirates has to play its part as well. Too many times this campaign has gone back to the bad old days of the crowd being too quick to grow restless. That can\u2019t be happening with our lack of attacking weapons. Eventually, trying to share goals around the side without a proven goalscorer will catch up with us, but this is a chance to send Liverpool to the Etihad with the gap between us at five points. Cherries 2-2 Wolves Performances under V\u00edtor Pereira have improved, but not all results have reflected that. Another five to ten minutes at Anfield, and they would have found an equaliser. That second-half performance might give them the confidence that attack is the best form of defence, and that\u2019s how they should approach the trip to the Vitality. Fulham 2-1 Palace Probably a convenient time to wish Reiss Nelson all the best after surgery. He\u2019s not a youngster anymore, but he still can\u2019t get that run of first-team football. He probably hasn\u2019t done enough to make his move to Craven Cottage permanent. I\u2019ll go for home advantage here. Ipswich 2-1 Spurs We seem to be living in an era where everyone takes offence the moment a pundit has an opinion they don\u2019t want to hear. James Maddison responded to Roy Keane\u2019s recent critique with a \u2018shhh\u2019 gesture\u2014the irony being that the celebration and his post-match interview confirmed Keane\u2019s whole perception of the player. Spurs are 12th in the league, have just gone out of two cups, and a talent who cost \u00a340 million has at times been on the bench. Put it this way: that\u2019s not how Roy Keane would have acted while playing for Manchester United if they were in that position. When the Tractor Boys have bad days, they can collapse like a deck of cards, and the visitors have the attacking talent to do some damage. It would be very Spursy, though, to lose to a side in 18th place in a week where they have got carried away. Saints 1-3 Brighton In a sport where everyone wants to find a reason for their failures, sometimes it\u2019s as simple as not being good enough. You can\u2019t fault the Saints for effort, but they simply lack quality in both areas. I can\u2019t see Brighton not scoring. Aston Villa 2-2 Chelsea Their European form shows Villa struggling with the schedule of playing every few days. Because they gave so much on Wednesday, that\u2019s the only reason I think the visitors will get a result. Chelsea fans are starting to turn on their manager\u2014not that they were ever delighted with him. They feel he lacks a plan B, and there were even signs that Cole Palmer was getting frustrated last Friday. After a 3-0 defeat, though, it\u2019s not the time for Enzo Maresca to be claiming that sixth place is ahead of schedule. He needs a result, and soon. Newcastle 3-1 Nott Forest Everyone connected to the Toon Army is making a conscious decision not to let being in the Carabao Cup final distract them from the league like it did last time. Given how they played last weekend, they will be worried history is repeating itself. That makes this Sunday huge in the race for the top four. Victory puts them only three points behind third-placed Forest. Man City 2-2 Liverpool My hope was that by the time Liverpool went to the Etihad, we couldn\u2019t afford for them to be ahead by more than the nine points that have been the case for a while. We now know that if we win on Saturday, they kick off on Sunday with that gap down to five. I\u2019ve said for a while that I don\u2019t think the league leaders have been playing well and that they concede chances too easily. We just haven\u2019t been consistent enough to take advantage. Beating West Ham, and suddenly Liverpool feel the pressure? Dropped points in Manchester, and suddenly the narrative starts to change. If only we had brought in an attacker in January\u2014I would be feeling more confident in this title race. Table to follow Dan Smith ADMIN COMMENT So here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow\u2026. You agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Luis Rubiales forcibly kissed Hermoso without consent after her team won the Women's World Cup in August 2023. | Fernando Villar/EFE via EPA February 20, 2025 2:55 pm CET By Csongor K\u00f6r\u00f6mi Former Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of a crime of sexual assault after forcibly kissing footballer Jenni Hermoso. Rubiales, who kissed Hermoso without consent after her team won the Women\u2019s World Cup in August 2023, was fined \u20ac10,800 by Spain\u2019s National Court, banned from approaching Hermoso within 200 meters and from communicating with her for one year. \u201cThis action of giving a woman a kiss on the mouth has a clear sexual connotation, and it is not the normal way of greeting people with whom one does not have an emotional relationship,\u201d Judge Jos\u00e9 Manuel Clemente Fern\u00e1ndez-Prieto said in his ruling on Thursday, El Pa\u00eds reported . Advertisement Advertisement However, Rubiales was acquitted of coercion, and the verdict gave him a much lighter sentence than what prosecutors had sought . They had asked for 30 months in prison and a much higher fine of \u20ac50,000. Rubiales\u2019 kiss-on-the-lips scandal sparked widespread criticism of sexism in football and led to his resignation as president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation. Prosecutors said the events created a situation of anxiety and intense stress for Hermoso that continued for several months afterward. Rubiales has publicly maintained his innocence, insisting that the kiss was consensual.

The manager later slammed the striker for taking the penalty despite being, in his words, \u2018one of the worst penalty takers I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 Lookman, understandably hurt by his coach\u2019s comments, responded with a public statement , saying he felt it was \u2018disrespectful\u2019 to be \u2018singled out\u2019 by Gasperini.

(JAVIER SORIANO / AFP) L'ex-patron de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration espagnole de football, Luis Rubiales, a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 jeudi 20 f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 une amende de 10 800 euros pour agression sexuelle en raison du baiser qu'il avait impos\u00e9, en ao\u00fbt 2023, \u00e0 la joueuse Jenni Hermoso . Luis Rubiales a en revanch\u00e9 \u00e9t\u00e9 relax\u00e9 pour les pressions qu'il \u00e9tait accus\u00e9 d'avoir exerc\u00e9es sur Jenni Hermoso pour \u00e9touffer le scandale, comme ses trois coaccus\u00e9s, l'ex-s\u00e9lectionneur Jorge Vilda et deux cadres de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Ces derniers \u00e9taient uniquement poursuivis pour ces faits. Le parquet avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 deux ans et demi de prison \u00e0 l'encontre de l'ex-pr\u00e9sident de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration espagnole de football (RFEF) : un an pour agression sexuelle et un an et demi pour les pressions exerc\u00e9es sur la joueuse pour minimiser la gravit\u00e9 du geste. \"Luis Rubiales a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire appel du jugement\" , a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Olga Tubau Martinez, l'avocate de l'ex-patron de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration espagnole de football. \"Aucun doute\" sur le caract\u00e8re non consenti du baiser Le tribunal de l'Audience nationale \"a condamn\u00e9 l'ancien pr\u00e9sident de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration royale espagnole de football (RFEF), Luis Rubiales, \u00e0 18 mois d'amende, avec un tarif journalier de 20 euros, pour le d\u00e9lit d'agression sexuelle\" , selon un communiqu\u00e9 consult\u00e9 par l'AFP. Il lui est \u00e9galement interdit de s'approcher de Jenni Hermoso \u00e0 moins de 200 m\u00e8tres et de communiquer avec elle pendant un an. Au terme du proc\u00e8s, la repr\u00e9sentante du parquet, Marta Dur\u00e1ntez Gil, avait estim\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait \"aucun doute\" sur le caract\u00e8re non consenti du baiser qu'avait impos\u00e9 Luis Rubiales \u00e0 Jenni Hermoso lors de la remise des m\u00e9dailles apr\u00e8s le sacre des Espagnoles au Mondial f\u00e9minin, le 20 ao\u00fbt 2023 en Australie. L'ancien dirigeant s'\u00e9tait dit \"absolument s\u00fbr\" que Jenni Hermoso avait consenti \u00e0 ce baiser . Erig\u00e9e en symbole de la lutte contre le sexisme dans le sport, Jenni Hermoso avait d'ailleurs r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouverture du proc\u00e8s, le 3 f\u00e9vrier, n'avoir jamais donn\u00e9 son consentement et assur\u00e9 s'\u00eatre sentie \"peu respect\u00e9e\" en tant que femme. La meilleure buteuse de la s\u00e9lection avait aussi d\u00e9crit les \"innombrables\" pressions subies apr\u00e8s ce geste pour \u00e9touffer le scandale.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. NERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group has taken vast areas of the eastern DRC and is marching on the strategic city of Uvira near the border with Burundi, triggering panic, with residents reporting widespread looting, bodies lying in the streets, and government forces commandeering boats to escape the insurgents\u2019 advance. M23 is also advancing on the city of Butembo north of Goma, which the armed group seized in January in an offensive that killed some 3,000 people. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has accused M23 of killing children and attacking hospitals and warehouses storing humanitarian aid, and says as many as 15,000 people have fled into Burundi in recent days. On Wednesday, the Congolese foreign minister addressed the U.N. Security Council. TH\u00c9R\u00c8SE KAYIKWAMBA WAGNER : We are looking for a political solution, and we\u2019re committed to it. The problem that we have is that despite the commitments that Rwanda or the lip service that Rwanda serves to the cause of a political solution, when we look on the ground, we see desolation; we see the constant advance of the M23; we see executions of children, as reported by the OHCHR yesterday; and we see that Rwanda is not being faithful or keeping their words and not being sincere in engaging in a political solution. NERMEEN SHAIKH : In an interview with CNN earlier this month, Rwandan President Paul Kagame claimed he was unaware of any Rwandan military troops fighting in the eastern DRC . LARRY MADOWO : Today, on the 3rd of February, does Rwanda currently have any troops at all in eastern DRC ? PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME : I don\u2019t know. LARRY MADOWO : You\u2019re the commander-in-chief. PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME : Yeah. There are many things I don\u2019t know. AMY GOODMAN : That was Kagame, the president of Rwanda, being interviewed by CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo. For more, we\u2019re joined by the Congolese analyst and activist Kambale Musavuli, who\u2019s now based in Accra, Ghana, policy analyst with the Center for Research on the Congo-Kinshasa, and his latest piece for Peoples Dispatch headlined \u201cThe battle for control of Goma continues.\u201d Welcome back to Democracy Now! , Kambale. It\u2019s great to have you with us again this week, but under horrible circumstances. Explain the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo for people who are not aware of what is happening, how dire it is, and what you think needs to happen. KAMBALE MUSAVULI : Since the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve had over 500,000 people who have been displaced in the east, added to the 6 million already displaced in the country. And this is caused by the uprising of the M23. It\u2019s a militia group that has existed in the Congo under different names. And this is their latest uprising. As they\u2019re taking over town after town, killings are taking place. For example, for the city of Goma, at least 3,000 people have been killed in the city during the battle of taking over Goma. And just yesterday, we\u2019re finding out more information about the taking over of the city of Bukavu. But this battle, which has been raging for close to 30 years, is always about the control of Congo\u2019s mineral wealth, and Congolese are paying the price. As the world needs Congo\u2019s resources, unfortunately, strong actions are not being taken to bring about peace and stability in the Congo. And we know what needs to happen. You know, international pressure on Rwanda, and Uganda, to some extent, will bring about peace and stability. It was done in 2012. It\u2019s not being done now. NERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Kambale, can you explain why you think that\u2019s the case? The last time you were the show, you said the same thing, as indeed in an opinion piece in The New York Times that appeared yesterday, Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege, a Congolese Nobel laureate, peace laureate, made exactly the same argument. So, what is the difference between 2012 and now? KAMBALE MUSAVULI : There seems to be, in my view, a geopolitical consideration from Western countries who benefit from Congo\u2019s resources. If you look at an article that came out just last month from Sky News, the reporter was analyzing the European Union. The European Union has an agreement with Rwanda on getting access to critical minerals. And they are refusing to cancel that agreement, when we all know that minerals being sold by Rwanda in the quantity that it\u2019s doing is actually coming from the DRC . The consideration for the European Union is that by canceling this contract, it will give ways to Russia and China getting access to mineral resources \u2014 clearly telling us that the lives of the millions of Congolese do not matter. That\u2019s on one level the reason why there is no action. The other one is the world apathy. The information being accessible or available on the DRC is there. Even African nations are not taking the necessary actions for that. So, this is about pitiful ordinary citizens. We are saying that we can\u2019t talk about the Fourth Industrial Revolution without Congo\u2019s resources, but we should not have blood in the technology devices that we are using. So it\u2019s up to the citizens in the biggest metropolitan, the United States, that\u2019s benefiting from the pilfering of Congo\u2019s resources, European nations, and including the U.K. World pressure of ordinary citizens is going to support the Congolese in the struggle to bring about peace and stability. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about the West\u2019s support for Rwanda. This goes to a number of issues. We just spoke to you a few days ago about the Oscar-nominated documentary Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat about what the U.S. did with its involvement in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first independence leader of modern-day Congo, and using Black jazz musicians in the United States in cementing the U.S. relationship and trying to get access to all the rare metals. Now I wanted to come here to 2025. Earlier this month, DRC\u2019s foreign minister urged three football clubs \u2014 Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 to end their, quote, \u201cbloodstained\u201d sponsorship agreements with \u201cVisit Rwanda,\u201d questioning the morality of such partnerships. Just today, Reuters reports Rwanda has described this criticism as a threat to regional peace and security. Meanwhile, the musician John Legend is scheduled to headline Global Citizen\u2019s Move Afrika tour and play in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, on Friday. The Nigerian Grammy-winning singer Tems recently canceled her appearance, saying, quote, \u201cSo I recently promoted my show in Rwanda without realizing that there is an ongoing conflict between Rwanda and Congo. I never ever intend to be insensitive to real-world issues, and I sincerely apologize if this came across that way. I simply had no idea this was going on. My heart goes out to those affected. Conflict is no joke and I truly hope and pray for peace in this time.\u201d If you can talk about both the concert, John Legend participating, but, of course, the bigger issue \u2014 also the sports teams \u2014 all this Western support for Rwanda and how it\u2019s furthered the conflict in Congo? KAMBALE MUSAVULI : This is a form of soft power that these institutions and individuals are doing. I mean, John Legend going to Rwanda in the midst of 3,000 people being killed, children being recruited by militia groups \u2014 and it\u2019s not that he\u2019s not aware. There have been a campaign for close to two months now letting him know that he should not attend. Now, Tems took action. So, all the people who support him \u2014 he\u2019s not the only one. Dave Chappelle traveled to Kigali and took a picture with Paul Kagame. You have even Kendrick Lamar, who was just headlining at the NFL , had a concert in Kigali, and at the end of the concert, he was on stage with Paul Kagame. So, when people in the United States watch the news and see Kendrick Lamar, see John Legend, see Dave Chappelle with Paul Kagame, and the usual people \u2014 you know, you have Tim Cook of Apple also with him \u2014 it creates an image that this is a great leader, a noncriminal leader, who\u2019s helping his country. So, it\u2019s a form of soft power to actually cover that. And we have to expose it. Now, this, as we pointed out in the film, Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat , showed that in the past the State Department and CIA used artists as a ploy for soft power. Right now the same thing is happening. I think that should be exposed. It\u2019s critical for ordinary people to challenge them, even not to go to the NBA . I mean, the NBA Africa, they are lobbying to engage on the African continent. On the day of the all-stars, there was a protest outside of the all-stars game, where ordinary Americans were saying the NBA has blood on its hands for collaborating with Rwanda. So, we have to expose all these contradictions, but we must not forget that this battle is very dire. People are being killed on a daily basis. Congo\u2019s territorial integrity is affected. The Congolese have called for Rwandan troops to leave. And all of us around the world, we have to do everything in our power to join the Free Congo campaign, to put pressure on Rwanda and any negative forces so the Congolese can have a chance to change the country. AMY GOODMAN : Kambale Musavuli, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Congolese analyst and activist, now based in Accra, Ghana, policy analyst with the Center for Research on the Congo-Kinshasa. We\u2019ll link to your latest piece in Peoples Dispatch. It\u2019s headlined \u201cThe battle for control of Goma continues.\u201d To see our extended interview with Kambale from a few days ago, you can go to democracynow.org, as well as a full interview with the director of the Oscar-nominated film Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat , that includes a number of clips of this documentary about U.S. involvement, Belgian involvement with the assassination of the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba and how the U.S. State Department deployed Black jazz musicians, who would later revolt against what they had done in Congo by protesting at the U.N. General Assembly after Lumumba was killed, shouting \u201cassassin\u201d and \u201cmurderer.\u201d I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

Opponent Khan says that's false A candidate for leadership of the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives said Wednesday there are books describing bestiality and incest in school libraries. His opponent says that's \"factually incorrect.\" Wally Daudrich, Obby Khan spar over accusations that books describe bestiality, incest Ian Froese \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Feb 20, 2025 8:47 AM EST | Last Updated: February 21 Manitoba Progressive Conservative leadership candidate Wally Daudrich accused his leadership rival Obby Khan of failing to remove pornographic books from schools. He said he's seen the literature himself but didn't specify where the books are located. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC) Social Sharing A candidate for leadership of the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives says there are books describing bestiality and incest in school libraries. At a leadership debate in Brandon on Wednesday, Wally Daudrich claimed there's \"pornography in schools,\" and alleged his rival in the PC leadership race, Fort Whyte MLA Obby Khan, was told about the books as a government minister but failed to remove them. \"You were approached by some of the mothers in Manitoba about pornography in the schools \u2014 pornography so egregious that it actually describes to 13, 14, 15-year-olds \u2026 how to have sex with an animal and how to have sex with your parents,\" said Daudrich, a Churchill hotelier and ecotourism operator. Khan responded that Daudrich's comments are \"factually incorrect.\" After the debate, Daudrich said he's seen the books, and bestiality is \"what they're promoting and that's part of what the book tells.\" He didn't say where the purported books are located. Obby Khan, left, and Wally Daudrich tangled as part of a Progressive Conservative leadership debate Wednesday at The Dome Building in Brandon, Man. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC) An audience member approached CBC News later in the evening to show a copy of Let's Talk About It: The Teen's Guide to Sex, Relationship, and Being a Human , a graphic novel with sketches that include depictions of genitals, intercourse and masturbation. The book was taken from South Central Regional Library, which has five branches in southern Manitoba but none in schools. Libraries are being accused of offering child porn. Librarians explain why that's not true Cheers as Brandon School Division rejects call to remove library books on sexuality, gender identity Daudrich didn't specify if this is one of the books he was talking about. CBC News couldn't immediately confirm if the book described bestiality and incest in any way. Sandy Nemeth, president of the Manitoba School Boards Association, said no books with that type of explicit content would be on the shelves of school libraries. \"At the end of the day, there's a great deal of misunderstanding about not only the content, but what is actually in the school libraries,\" she said in an interview. \"Mr. Daudrich does everybody a great disservice by spouting off the way he has without any sort of proof or anything to back up some of the comments that he's making.\" Nemeth said libraries have books that discuss sexual identity and gender identity, but any literature is carefully screened to ensure it's appropriate for students. Autonomy over book choices Khan said it is up to municipalities or school divisions to decide which books belong in their libraries. As the former minister of sport, culture and heritage, Khan said he recommended books about sensitive topics be moved into age-appropriate areas of libraries. He told CBC News after the debate the former PC government was trying to develop these rules but they weren't finalized before the Tories were defeated in the 2023 election by the NDP. During the hour-long debate, attended by nearly 100 people and live-streamed online, Daudrich continued to characterize homelessness as a lifestyle people choose. Living on the streets, Daudrich said, is a \"compilation of choices in our life,\" and people should \"take some responsibility for our actions.\" Daudrich also dismissed Khan's request he apologize for his earlier joke that homelessness in Winnipeg could be reduced by letting polar bears loose downtown. Manitoba Tory leadership candidate jokes about letting polar bears loose to combat homelessness 17 organizations call for review of Wally Daudrich's Manitoba PC leadership candidacy He said he likes to use humour to make his point, before adding \"it's a decision for a government, whether it's Winnipeg, Thompson or Brandon, if you're going to have homeless people. That's your choice.\" His remarks prompted Portage la Prairie MLA Jeff Bereza, who has endorsed Khan's leadership bid, to heckle \"wow\" a few times, and moderator Deveryn Ross, a political commentator, to ask if Daudrich would repeat his comments to a family whose breadwinner has terminal cancer and is on the verge of homelessness. Daudrich interrupted Ross, accusing the moderator of taking sides, which prompted applause from some of his supporters. Daudrich then asked Khan to look at him as he said he donates more money to charity every year than the annual amount he made in the first 30 years of his life. That was an attempt to counter Khan, who he felt was alleging he's an uncaring person, Daudrich said after the debate. PC leadership candidate Obby Khan leads Wally Daudrich in MLA endorsements Analysis A potential U.S. trade war has breathed some life into the fraught idea of shipping oil through Hudson Bay The event, hosted at The Dome Building in Brandon, proved to be the most heated affair of the six-month race to replace Heather Stefanson as leader of the Tories. Lac du Bonnet MLA Wayne Ewasko has served as interim leader since Stefanson's resignation in early 2024. The two candidates have until Feb. 28 to sign up new party members. Voting starts in March and a new leader will be announced April 26. Verbal jabs were flying within the opening minutes of Wednesday's debate, with Daudrich saying there's two types of people in the world, talkers and doers, and \"my friend Obby is a talker.\" \"He talks about how his experience as a sitting MLA qualifies him to be our party's leader and Manitoba's next premier. Obby, you're a great guy, but the Blue Bombers would never hire a head coach and general manager with one-and-a-half years' involvement in football.\" Daudrich then spoke of his 30 years running a successful business and wondered how many fundraisers Khan has hosted for the PCs or how much money he's raised. PC leadership candidate Obby Khan says he's running an inclusive campaign focused on bringing people together and that he could be more effective as a leader because he has a seat in the legislature. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC) \"You've already seen the class of my opponent,\" Khan said in response, \"taking shots right off the bat, insulting me by talking about talker and doer. I will let him talk about his leadership style. I will talk about mine.\" The MLA proceeded to repeat some of his refrains from the campaign trail, including that he's running an inclusive campaign focused on bringing people together and that he could be more effective as a leader than Daudrich because he has a seat in the legislature. Khan was first elected in 2022. He said if Daudrich was serious about leading the Tories he'd seek to be the party's candidate for the Transcona byelection on March 18. Daudrich, who ran unsuccessfully for federal office in Churchill as a Conservative candidate in 2008 and 2011, has portrayed himself as the only true conservative in the race and the sole person with the business acumen to grow the province. In response to several debate questions, Daudrich touted his support for the NeeStaNan project , a second deepwater port on Hudson Bay that would include a shipping corridor to transport bitumen or natural gas. He said it would be an economic windfall for the province. New Season The Fifth Estate: The Shadow War on Libraries Khan alleged the project, which has yet to be approved, is Daudrich's only plan to grow the economy. If the Tories are elected in the next election, Daudrich also promised to raise the corporate tax rate's threshold in Manitoba, so only businesses with at least $1 million in income, higher than the current $500,000 threshold, would pay the levy. Khan, who vowed to reduce \"punitive\" taxes on businesses, spent time during the debate criticizing Daudrich for previously arguing some Tory caucus members weren't working hard enough. He said Daudrich wouldn't be a successful leader if he insults the MLAs he seeks to represent.

Share Facebook X/Twitter LinkedIn Email Copy URL This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Expos\u00e9. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats , and has resulted in several human cases in the US , including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand\u2019s Biosecurity Minister yesterday , a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI \u201cVaccines Work\u201d was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada . And so, it goes on. Countries\u2019 pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. \u201cLearn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,\u201d he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem \u2013 our so-called \u201cpublic health\u201d and \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d \u201cexperts\u201d \u2013 are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let\u2019s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of \u201cpandemic preparedness,\u201d genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, \u201cpublic health\u201d authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, \u201cpublic health\u201d authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of \u201cpandemic preparedness,\u201d have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production , \u201cpublic health\u201d authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals , creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, \u201cpublic health\u201d authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The \u201cpandemic planners\u201d are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here\u2019s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment \u2013 you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA\u2019s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump\u2019s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump\u2019s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era \u201cpandemic planning\u201d model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD \u2019s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks , should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (\u201cOPPR\u201d).Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump\u2019s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA\u2019s reported \u201cconditional approval\u201d of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation , all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d racket isn\u2019t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department \u2013 as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well \u2013 we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one \u201casymptomatic\u201d positive PCR test, they\u2019re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump\u2019s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation\u2019s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. RavenCrest on February 21, 2025 at 5:26 am SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump\u2019s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I\u2019ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities.

The Magpies will make the trip to Meadow Park, with kick-off scheduled for 7pm (UK time). Mehmet Ali's side have won two of their first three games of 2025, including a 2 - 1 victory over Middlesbrough last time out. Khayon Edwards put us ahead in that game, and after the visitors equalised from the penalty spot, Michal Rosiak netted the winner in the 80th minute. Read more U21s report: Arsenal 2-1 Middlesbrough The Opposition Newcastle have had a tough start to 2025, taking just one point from their four matches of the calendar year and conceding 15 goals across these games. The first half of the season was far more fruitful for the North East side, who won six of their first ten league games. This is an important game in the race for Premier League 2 playoff qualification, with 14th-place Newcastle just two points behind us in 10th; the top 16 qualify for the playoffs. Striker Ben Parkinson has been the danger man for the Magpies this season, scoring eight goals in 13 appearances. How to Follow You can attend the match in person for free.

Both Rubiales and Hermoso are to appeal the verdict. https://p.dw.com/p/4qmzt Former Spain FA boss Luis Rubiales has been fined for sexually assaulting player Jenni Hermoso Image: Susana Vera/REUTERS Advertisement Former Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of sexually assaulting Jenni Hermoso by kissing her on the lips without her consent after the 2023 Women's World Cup final and fined \u20ac10,800 euros ($11,284), Spain's High Court revealed on Thursday. He was also ordered not to go within 200 meters (656 feet) of Hermoso or contact the player for a year. Rubiales was, however, acquitted of coercion. The charges against Rubiales included kissing Hermoso without her consent and then attempting to coerce Hermoso into declaring the kiss as consensual. Rubiales denied the charges, saying the kiss had been consensual. Hermoso said the opposite , adding she \"felt disrespected\" by Rubiales after the final, and that the kiss had \"stained one of the happiest days of my life.\" In a high-profile case that sparked a conversation in Spain about sexism , prosecutors had pushed for two and a half years in prison for Rubiales \u2014 one year for sexual assault, and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident. Rubiales' defense team had argued he should be acquitted of both charges. The three other people who had also been tried for allegedly pressuring Hermoso into saying the kiss had been consensual were cleared. Positive reaction \"When there is no consent there is assault and that is what the judge certifies in this sentence, Spain's equality minister, Ana Redondo wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \"The victim's word is honored, as the law stipulates, and should not be questioned,\" Irene Montero, a member of the European Parliament and prominent Spanish feminist, lamented the \"minimum fine and damages,\" but still praised the court decision. \"Not long ago, it was unthinkable that a court would recognize a kiss without consent as a sexual assault. Feminism is changing everything: Only 'yes' means 'yes',\" she said. The Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE), which was a private prosecutor in the case, described the ruling as \"a significant step forward in the defense of women's rights and in the fight for a sport free of abuse and inequality.\" Hermoso, Rubiales to appeal On Friday, the AFP news agency reported that Hermoso intended to appeal the sentence. \"It is her intention\" to appeal the sentence Hermoso' lawyer, Angel Chavarr\u00eda, told AFP. Rubiales' defense team said shortly after Thursday's verdict that they intended to appeal the decision. This article was originally published on February 20, 2025. It was updated on February 21, 2025 with reactions and the news that both parties intend to go to appeal.

Sophie Harwood spoke to us recently, and here's what she had to say about recovering from injury, feeling at home here and more. I've absolutely loved my first few months playing at Arsenal. When I first joined the club, I was still in the process of rehabbing an injury and hadn\u2019t played a football match for nine months. I had the U17 World Cup in my sights during my recovery and I made it back just in time. In fact, my first minutes back were at the World Cup! Football is my life so not being able to play for nine months was definitely the hardest thing I've had to go through. I love the game so when it\u2019s taken away, it really tests your resilience and how mentally strong you are. I feel like I came out the other side even better and even stronger, so I see that as all part of the journey. It's just about trusting the process. The girls and all of the staff here are so amazing and they\u2019ve made me feel at home immediately. I\u2019ve already made some close friends who have supported me across these first few months at Arsenal. Part of what\u2019s so good about this team is that we\u2019re all friends on and off the pitch and that closeness shows with our performances. We link up so well. I had a great seven years at Southampton, but Arsenal was an offer I couldn\u2019t say no to. The history of the club when it comes to women\u2019s football is just amazing but I also made this change because of the player development provided here. It\u2019s incredible. I'm a very attacking full-back, who loves to drive forward and contribute to the team in terms of goals and assists. But I love defending too! I take pride in my 1v1s and I\u2019ll stop at nothing to win back the ball. I\u2019m relatively new to the position as I grew up mostly playing in midfield, so my focus over the past few seasons has been on becoming as well-rounded full-back as I can be. Some of my favourite Arsenal moments so far have been getting my first couple of assists for the club, helping the team win and beating Manchester United in the Cup. It\u2019s always a tough game against United but all the girls put in a shift and we played some really good football that showed in the result. \"Both the Lionesses and Arsenal are incredibly high-performing, so that drives me on\" Away from Arsenal, the U17 World Cup was one of the best experiences I've ever had. Going over to the Dominican Republic and playing against some top nations from across the world with different styles of play was a great learning experience. To get to play with so many Arsenal players too was amazing as we already had that team chemistry. It was mentally challenging to not get as far as we\u2019d hoped but we\u2019re all proud of the team\u2019s achievement and look back on the tournament as a massively positive experience. And of course, to do it with so many Arsenal players as well, obviously already having that chemistry from the Arsenal team and transferring out to England, I think that was great, but of course, it was again, mentally challenging, not getting as far as we hoped. But I think we should still be proud of our achievements and reflect on it as a positive experience. Since then, I\u2019ve had my first call-up to the England U19s camp and I\u2019ve really enjoyed the change so far. It\u2019s a good transition between the age groups and there are so many talented players to learn from. It\u2019s also more physical so I want to keep pushing at this level now. There are interesting similarities and differences between international football and academy football. My time with the Lionesses is often more obviously competitive because we\u2019re playing knockout, tournament football. At Arsenal, we obviously still want the right result, but 100% of our focus is on our performance. Both environments are incredibly high-performing so that drives me on. Constant progression is always what I\u2019m aiming towards but this season specifically, I'm hoping to make a senior team debut. When we train at Sobha Realty Training Centre, the focus and professionalism of everyone there is a fantastic example for us. Being around players you\u2019ve looked up to for so long is inspiring and helps raise your own level. It\u2019s just a case of putting in the work every single day to try and improve myself, to be in the best position for any opportunities that may arise.

He was acquitted of coercion, for allegedly trying to pressure Hermoso into saying publicly that the kiss was consensual. As Spain's players received their medals after defeating England in Sydney to win the 2023 World Cup, Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips. The incident triggered protests and calls for the resignation of Rubiales, who has said he will appeal against the verdict. The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200m radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year, the court said in a statement. Three of Rubiales's former colleagues who were also on trial, accused of colluding in the alleged coercion - Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rub\u00e9n Rivera, the Real Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de F\u00fatbol (RFEF)'s former head of marketing, and Albert Luque, former sporting director - were cleared of those charges. Prosecutors had demanded a prison sentence for Rubiales, who last week told a court he was \"absolutely sure\" Hermoso had given her consent before he kissed her. He described the kiss as an \"act of affection\", adding that in the moment it was \"something completely spontaneous\". In her testimony earlier this month, Hermoso insisted that she had not given Rubiales permission and that the incident had \"stained one of the happiest days of my life\". She told the court in Madrid: \"My boss was kissing me, and this shouldn't happen in any social or work setting.\" \"A kiss on the lips is only given when I decide so,\" she said at the time. Rubiales was accused of sexual assault and of trying to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss had been consensual. The incident was witnessed by millions of television viewers and an entire stadium after the Spanish women's team won the 2023 World Cup. The ensuing uproar gave momentum to a \"Me Too\"-style movement in the Spanish women's game, in which players sought to combat sexism and achieve parity with their male peers. Rubiales resigned in September 2023 following weeks of resisting pressure to stand down, and after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation.

Prosecutors had sought prison sentence for sexual assault; Rubiales also acquitted of coercion Thomson Reuters \u00b7 Posted: Feb 20, 2025 8:02 AM EST | Last Updated: February 20 Former president of the Spanish football federation, Luis Rubiales, is shown in this file photo. Rubiales was found guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent, but acquitted of coercion on Thursday in Madrid. (Oscar Del Pozo/AFP via Getty Images) Social Sharing Spain's High Court said on Thursday it had found former soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent, and set a fine of over 10,000 euros, but acquitted him of coercion. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales in a case that sparked a debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society. \"The ruling bans Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year,\" the court said in a statement. Rubiales, 47, was accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso on the mouth. He was also accused \u2013 along with three other former soccer federation officials \u2013 of attempting to then coerce her into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual. A lawyer for Hermoso was not immediately available for comment.

According to ESPN\u2019s Dan Graziano , the league\u2019s 2025 salary cap is expected to rise by over $20 million. Minimum . Given that the NFL\u2019s cap usually grows by about $10 million yearly (which is what estimates projected it to be this time around, too), this development is pretty shocking. It\u2019s also fantastic news for Super Bowl contenders like the Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills, and Cincinnati Bengals . Well, to be fair, it\u2019s actually only fantastic news if you\u2019re a diehard Bengals fan or a player on the active roster. If you\u2019re owner Mike Brown or general manager Duke Tobin, you\u2019ve now been backed into a corner by the very same uber-successful league that gives you a purpose and lets you print money by putting any old product out there on the football field. That\u2019s right. You now have to begrudgingly keep your championship contender intact for the foreseeable future. Oh no! Heaven forbid! Ugh. That sucks so much for a billionaire vulture such as Brown, who is perpetually deadset on pinching pennies wherever he can instead of investing as much as possible in a source of genuine civic pride for a major region of Ohio. Folks, per Sports Illustrated , this is the same gentleman who has had the Bengals, on average, spend 2.1 percent less cash than the unadjusted salary cap than most NFL teams in the last five years. You know, the same time frame where the Bengals were arguably the best they\u2019ve ever been. So, you gotta feel for Brown here. Wait, hold on. Before we proceed, let me find my tiny violin so I can play it \u2026 OK, I\u2019m good. Please continue. If you\u2019re Brown especially, a salary cap increase of over $20 million in one offseason means you now have no also legitimate means of justifying breaking up your core, as you were clearly intent on doing beforehand. Being compliant with the cap is a huge domino in this regard. It can\u2019t be used as an excuse in any way, shape, or form. It means that star receiver Tee Higgins, fresh off another franchise tag, should get the bag he deserves. The same sentiment applies to his electric playmaking teammate Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Trey Hendrickson, the NFL\u2019s sack leader in 2024. In the words of the immortal Rod Tidwell: show them the money. In fairness to Brown, he has handed out some rich contracts in the recent past, particularly in the 21st century. According to Sporskeeda , the five bigger Bengals player deals ever have all been handed out in the last approximately 20 years, including Joe Burrow\u2019s. And Higgins, Chase, and Hendrickson are all rightly poised to join (and dwarf) that exclusive club. If you\u2019re Brown, you can no longer cry poor. You can no longer pretend the NFL\u2019s books are keeping you from putting all hands on deck for your football team. It\u2019s time to start writing some blank checks and paying your bills. This massive salary cap increase ensures there\u2019s enough cake for everyone to eat in Cincinnati and then some. Bengals fans and players deservedly won\u2019t expect any less.

This week woz clapped, fam. Man told parentdem dat Active J woz goin\u2019 to a brand drop an\u2019 woz gonna get loads of free merch drip. Parentdem sed den Joshua \u2018ad to ditch him\u2019s old fit as there woz no room for any more. Even da drip dat Active J woz savin\u2019 to accept man\u2019s MOBO award, innit.

Active J \u2018ad never heard of da charity shop brand, so man Googled an\u2019 found it is shops where old ladies take drip for free an\u2019 sell it to random brand muggles for pennies. You wot, fam? Dem ladies don\u2019t heven wear da surgical gloves to protect drip from dem\u2019s biscuit fingers, innit.

Lady G sed man should put heveryfink on Vinted, an app like a charity shop wivout da old ladies, dat sells straight to other bruv roadmen. So peng gyal helped man list him\u2019s drip, but her sed man should use photos of da items only an\u2019 not da photos of Active J bustin\u2019 swag in da drip coz it wud make da buyers jealous.

Pengest crew hever, innit. Sleaford Mods, and other bands whose regional accents ruin their songs 20th February 2025 LOVE the Sleaford Mods\u2019 music but hate the shouty Nottingham accent all over it? Can\u2019t relax while aurally assaulted by provincial tones? You\u2019ll hate these: Billy Bragg Even if you passionately believe in the messages of Bragg\u2019s lumpen lefty anthems, they can\u2019t be fully enjoyed because they\u2019re all bellowed in his ear-batteringly awfil Essex accent. Does it emphasise his working class roots and proudly socialist beliefs? Definitely. Does it sound pleasant coming from the speakers in your living room when you\u2019re trying to enjoy a full-bodied Rioja? Absolutely not. Kate Nash You could be forgiven for thinking that Kate Nash and Foundations was a one hit wonder and is over now, and yet 18 years later she\u2019s still touring and releasing new music. Unfortunately, she hasn\u2019t got rid of the Cockney \u2013 or uncharitably, Mockney \u2013 accent that made her biggest single such a f**king ordeal to hear. Never have the words \u2018fitter\u2019 and \u2018bitter\u2019 been more painfully rhymed. Tricky When you hear the cool, minimalist beats of a trip-hop song starting up, what\u2019s the very last thing you want to start rapping over it? A broad Bristolian accent. While the south west city was the cradle of some of the best music of the 90s, at least Massive Attack and Portishead had the courtesy not to mumble across their records like a depressed Wurzel. Tricky should have just let Martina Topley-Bird do it all, she sounded great. Sleaford Mods Sleaford Mods\u2019 angry explorations of working class life provide important social commentary on austerity-era Britain. But unfortunately all those blisteringly incisive lyrics are bellowed in a thick East Midlands accent making them horribly abrasive to listen to. They\u2019re important, if you like that sort of thing, but if you wanted to be berated by a furious man from Nottingham you\u2019d go there and start a fight in a pub. Sophie Ellis-Bextor The notion of a murder on a dance floor sounds pretty exciting, right? Blood splattered on the disco ball, lights flashing on the bodies. Just like a Tarantino film. However, when the song is sung in Sophie Ellis-Bextors RP boarding school accent, it loses any cool it possessed and sounds like somebody\u2019s being told off for not doing their homework. You better not kill the groove or you\u2019ll be given a hundred lines. Damon Albarn Is he a genuine Cockney or is Damon Albarn\u2019s cheek-chappy Laaandan accent fake? Given his parents were incredibly middle-class and he spent most of his formative years in an Essex village, it probably is. But real or not, it\u2019s f**king annoying and still continues to be, despite the fact he\u2019s had a 35-year long career in which to gradually round off the edges and start singing normally.

Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales in a case that sparked a debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society. \"The ruling bans Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year,\" the court said in a statement. Rubiales, 47, was accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso on the mouth. He was also accused - along with three other former soccer federation officials - of attempting to then coerce her into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual.

He was also accused \u2014 along with three other former soccer federation officials \u2014 of attempting to then coerce her into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual. A lawyer for Hermoso was not immediately available for comment.

Sports Staggering Amount Of Money That Taylor Swift Has Earned The NFL Revealed In New Report #Taylor Swift Follow Us by Eric Italiano Last Updated Feb 20, 2025 8:01 am Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images Suspicions about Taylor Swift being a business boon for the National Football League have now been confirmed, as a new report has put a number on how much she\u2019s earned the league since she began dating Travis Kelce in 2023, and that number is north of $1 billion. Given Taylor Swift\u2019s popularity with the female demographic and the rapid loyalty of her core fanbase, her entering the NFL world was always going to help bring some new eyeballs to the already dominant sport. The actual data behind Swift\u2019s monetary contribution to the NFL , however, puts her impact in far bigger perspective, as she\u2019s now earned the NFL over $1 billon in \u201ctotal equivalent brand value.\u201d \u201cFrom Sep. 24, 2023, to Jan. 28, 2024 \u2014 the date of that year\u2019s AFC Championship game \u2014 Swift created $366,753,290 in total equivalent brand value for the NFL, according to data provided to MarketWatch from Apex Marketing, a company that specializes in advertising and branding services.\u201d \u201cIn the year since, Swift has helped the NFL even more, according to Apex, creating an estimated $634,304,163 in equivalent brand value from the day after the 2024 AFC Championship through Jan. 27, the day after the 2025 AFC Championship.\u201d [via MarketWatch ] Just to put that number \u2014 a total of $1,001,057,453 \u2014 into further perspective, reports indicate that the NFL earned $2.49 billion in sponsorship revenue last season. Luckily for NFL fans who were tired of the attention that T. Swift received on game days, the 2024 season may be the last time she cheers Travis Kelce on from the stands as reports indicate he is weighing up retirement this offseason. In Super Bowl LIX against the Philadelphia Eagles, Kelce had just 4 catches for 39 yards, which came after a season in which he put up the lowest yardage total (823 receiving yards) and receiving touchdowns (3) of his career bar his rookie season in 2013.

The 32-year-old has been a free agent since last summer when he was released by the Scottish Premiership side. Roofe, who earned five international caps for Jamaica in 2021, last featured in English football with Leeds in 2019. His time with the Yorkshire side ended with a goal against Derby at Pride Park in the first leg of a Championship play-off semi-final tie that the Rams went on to sensationally win on aggregate at Elland Road. Roofe says becoming the first signing of new Derby boss John Eustace was not something he expected. \"I'm here now and I'm excited to get going,\" he told the club website. , external Roofe brings goal-scoring knowhow to Rams - Eustace Published 1 day ago Eustace admits 'risk' of Derby move from Blackburn Published 13 February How Eustace ghosted into Derby on mission to rescue Rams Published 7 days ago Roofe, who had a season in Belgium with Anderlecht between his time at Leeds and Rangers, has not featured in a competitive match for more than nine months. He was released after four years with Rangers, a club where he won the Scottish Premiership, Scottish Cup and League Cup. The forward says he has worked hard while waiting for an opportunity to restart his career. \"It was down to mental strength, to get through what I needed to get through,\" he said. Roofe joins a Derby side that are in the Championship relegation places and who have managed to score just four goals in a 10-game winless league run dating back to late December.

( Reuters: Violeta Santos Moura ) In short: Ex-Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of the sexual assault of a female footballer in 2023. The 47-year-old kissed Jenni Hermoso on the mouth without her consent in Sydney. What's next? Rubiales has been ordered to pay a fine, stay more than 200-metres away from Ms Hermoso and not communicate with her for a year. abc.net.au/news/luis-rubiales-guilty-of-kissing-jenni-hermoso-without-consent/104963178 Link copied Share Share article Spain's High Court has found former Spanish soccer head Luis Rubiales guilty of kissing star striker Jenni Hermoso on the lips without consent, after the Women's World Cup final in Sydney in 2023. Rubiales, 47, was accused of sexual assault and coercion over allegations he tried to pressure Ms Hermoso into declaring the kiss was consensual. Jenni Hermoso gives evidence on day one of Luis Rubiales's trial Photo shows A smiling man wearing a suit embraces a woman wearing a football uniform Several of Spanish soccer's former top male officials are on trial in Madrid. The court ordered him to pay a fine worth more than 10,000 euros ($16,300), but acquitted him of the charge of coercion. Judge Jose Manuel Fernandez-Prieto ruled that the sexual assault, \"while always reproachable\" was of minor intensity as there was no violence or intimidation. \"The Judge understands that, in view of the magnitude of the assault, a kiss, that it is a sporadic act of the accused, and that he does not require special rehabilitation for the crime, the pecuniary penalty must be chosen, which is less serious than the custodial sentence,\" the verdict said. In a statement, the court said it had also banned Rubiales from getting within 200 metres of Ms Hermoso or communicating with her for a year. Following the ruling, Rubiales told news agency Reuters he intended to appeal the decision, saying he was \"going to keep fighting\". Rubiales has avoided a prison sentence, which the prosecution had been pushing for throughout the trial. The ex-football federation chief has maintained through this month's trial that Ms Hermoso had consented to the kiss. But she later told the court she never consented to the kiss and had not been expecting it. During the trial, Ms Hermoso said the unsolicited kiss from her boss and the commotion that followed \"tainted one of the happiest days of my life\", while her teammates testified it left her overwhelmed, crying and exhausted in the following hours and days. Spain's Jenni Hermoso seen during a Women's World Cup game in Wellington in 2023. ( AP: John Cowpland ) The incident, which happened during the awards ceremony following Spain's victory at the World Cup final, triggered widespread debate in Spain about sexism in women's football . It also led to wider reflections about the issue in Spanish society. While celebrating on the podium, Rubiales was seen grabbing Ms Hermoso and kissing her on the lips. The scene at Stadium Australia was broadcast to millions of viewers who had tuned in to watch Spain face off against England in the World Cup final. Rubiales was accused of sexual assault in the aftermath, and was also accused \u2014 along with three other former Spanish federation officials \u2014 of attempting to then coerce Ms Hermoso into saying the kiss was consensual. The kiss sparked 'shame, anger, rage'. For some, what happened next was worse Photo shows A man holds a woman's head and kisses her. A Foreign Correspondent investigation has detailed the decades of sexism and misogyny leading up to the infamous World Cup kiss. Following the incident, Rubiales resigned from his post at the soccer federation in September 2023 and was barred from working in the sport for three years. The three men were former women's team coach Jorge Vilda, sports director of the men's team Albert Luque, and head of marketing Ruben Rivera. All three were acquitted of coercion. In fining Rubiales, the court ruled he would have to pay 20 euros ($32) a day over an 18-month period. Spain's leftist government, which had demanded Rubiales' removal from the office, hailed the verdict as upholding the victim's accusations. \"When there is no consent there is assault and that is what the judge certifies in this sentence. The victim's word is honoured, as the law stipulates, and should not be questioned,\" Equality Minister Ana Redondo wrote on X. Lawyers for Hermoso were not immediately available for comment.

The former La Liga defender was also one of UEFA's vice-presidents before resigning in September 2023, following the scandal with Hermoso. Rubiales was ordered to pay a fine over \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,274) by Spain's High Court, though he was acquitted of coercion. Advert Prosecutors demanded a prison sentence for the ex-Levante player , who made 53 appearances in the Spanish top flight. The former Spanish football president has been punished (FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images) Rubiales had already been banned from all football activities for three years from 2023 following the controversial kiss, according to FIFA. The incident took place after Spain's FIFA Women's World Cup final victory over England, where they emerged 1-0 victors. Advert 47-year-old Rubiales was congratulating Spanish players with their medals before the trophy presentation, when he kissed the 34-year-old national team top scorer without consent. Hermoso, who now plays for Liga MX Femenil club Tigres UANL, also boasts the most Pichichi trophies in women's football history. She said during Rubiales' trial in Madrid that she 'never' agreed to him kissing her on the lips, explaining that it 'tainted one of the happiest days' in her life. Advert Rubiales was accused of sexual assault, and for attempting to coerce Hermoso into stating that the kiss was consensual. He continuously denied these charges, saying that it was consensual and it took place during a 'moment of jubilation'. However, the Spanish striker repeatedly said the opposite, insisting that it was not consensual. The football chief was banned from football activity for three years already (Noemi Llamas/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images) Advert The incident proved to be a pivotal moment for Spain's female players to point on sexism in the sport and seek equality with the male team. Hermoso claimed that she 'felt disrespected' in court, adding: \"I didn't hear or understand anything,\" recalling, \"The next thing he did was to grab me by the ears and kiss me on the mouth.\" She said: \"I knew I was being kissed by my boss and that should not happen in any social or work environment. \"I think it was a moment that tainted one of the happiest days of my life. Advert \"All this meant I couldn't enjoy at all being a world champion after I landed back in Madrid.\" The fallout following the scandal led to a boycott of both the men's and women's national teams, which sparked protests across the nation. They demanded 'a sport free of sexist violence', while Rubiales said she was the target of a 'witch hunt' by people she described as 'false feminists'.

president found guilty over kissing player Jenni Hermoso without consent after Women's World Cup final Luis Rubiales stood accused of sexual assault and attempting to coerce Jenni Hermoso into declaring the kiss, which happened after the Women's World Cup final in 2023, had been consensual; Rubiales denied the charges, claiming the kiss was consensual, and will appeal the ruling Friday 21 February 2025 07:31, UK Image: Former Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales was handed an 18-month fine equating to \u20ac20 a day Former Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of sexually assaulting forward Jenni Hermoso but avoided a jail sentence. Rubiales told Reuters on Thursday that he would appeal the court ruling which found him guilty of kissing Hermoso without her consent. The Audiencia Nacional court in Spain said it had imposed an 18-month fine equating to \u20ac20 a day on Rubiales, who it found had kissed Hermoso without her consent during the medal ceremony after Spain won the Women's World Cup in 2023. The ruling also prohibits Rubiales from going within 200 metres of Hermoso or communicating with her for one year.

Enable Cookies Allow Cookies Once Rubiales was acquitted of trying to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss was consensual. Former Spanish national team coach Jorge Vilda was also found not guilty of coercion, along with other Spanish federation staff members at the time, Albert Luque and Ruben Rivera. Rubiales was banned for three years from all football activity in October 2023 over his conduct at the World Cup final in Sydney, which was upheld on appeal in January 2024. FIFA said at the time the appeal was upheld: \"FIFA reiterates its absolute commitment to respecting and protecting the integrity of all people and ensuring that the basic rules of decent conduct are upheld.\" Prosecutors had requested a custodial sentence of two-and-a-half years for Rubiales - one year for the kiss and 18 months for coercion - the court said in a statement confirming the verdict reached by Judge Jose Manuel Clemente Fernandez-Prieto. The ruling of this court can be appealed against before the Criminal Division of the National Court. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Charlotte Duncker and David Ornstein react to the news that former Spanish football boss Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of sexual assault after kissing Jenni Hermoso without consent after the 2023 World Cup final A further release from the court said that the judge had analysed the crime of sexual assault and found that in this case it had been committed by \"carrying out in a surprising way an act that violates the sexual freedom of another person without the consent of the assaulted\". \"It is a reprehensible act carried out by the defendant within the euphoria of the celebration of having won the World Cup, an unprecedented success in Spanish women's football,\" the judge said, according to the court release. The release said the judge gave \"full credibility\" to the testimony given by Hermoso, who stressed throughout that the kiss was non-consensual. 'Verdict is a landmark moment' Sky News' Rob Harris: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky News' Rob Harris explains the verdict for Luis Rubiales after he was found guilty of sexual assault on Jenni Hermoso \"It's huge in Spain and also represents a culture shift in the fact women's football is top of the agenda in Spain. \"This incident has been heavily scrutinised. There were dozens of crews outside, which was notable as well because this was a live televised court broadcast across Spain. Outside, there was a huge scrum around Rubiales and reporters attempting to get questions from him. \"It has really shone a focus on the inequalities in Spanish women's football already in the year before this World Cup. Many players had refused to play for the national side over concerns and disagreements about the treatment they were receiving from Jorge Vilda. \"He left in the fallout from this, he backed Rubiales and is now the head coach of the women's team in Morocco. \"Certainly for Spain, it's led to them asking some deeper questions - not only about football but also wider society - about misogyny and sexism. In terms of this verdict, it's quite a landmark moment. \"There is an appeal process. For Rubiales being cleared of coercion, it's something that was being scrutinised quite heavily during the trial. The statements put out in Hermoso's name after the final and claims on the plane back to Madrid that Rubiales attempted to get her to film a video before eventually he filmed one himself in Doha. \"There was that heavy focus on how much she was put under pressure to downplay the incident and it was even being looked at various things in the dressing room about why she was smiling and enjoying herself. \"She had to say she was crying inside and not wanting to take away from the celebrations, winning a Women's World Cup for the first time. \"Rubiales is already serving a three-year ban which was imposed by FIFA in 2023. It's a huge downfall for him, from one of the most senior people in football and a senior vice-president at UEFA, head of the Spanish federation too.\" Tome: Football is our salvation Spain head coach Montse Tome : \"We have not experienced a situation like this and it's something that escapes us a little bit from what we (normally) have in our daily lives. Image: Spain's coach Montse Tome speaks with Jenni Hormoso while on international duty \"It's normal for me to have had that feeling in particular. They have not been easy days, but we have faced them. Within that time, for me, and I think for the players too, salvation is football. \"For them to train and for me to watch them and all the team (feels) the same. I think with Jenni she knows that as I have said, there is a professional relationship with all the players. \"We've always talked a lot with Jenni. Right now, we need these 23 players to be able to face Belgium and England (in the Nations League).\" Bronze: Spain players are brave for fighting for change Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Lucy Bronze shares her support for all of the Spanish players involved in the Luis Rubiales case and gives an insight into how some of her former Barcelona team-mates have dealt with it all England defender Lucy Bronze, who played for Barcelona at the time of the World Cup, hailed Hermoso and her Spain team-mates for \"standing up for change\". Speaking before the verdict, Bronze said: \"It's been incredible that the players have had to go through that. Not only winning the World Cup and the media outside of it but they are in the court case and they are speaking out. \"It's incredibly brave of the individuals and the team involved. They are fighting for change - not just within the court case - but they are fighting for change in their federation. It's amazing. \"As an England team, we've made changes in our federation - not at the same extent or for the same reason - but we stand by the Spanish players. As a team, we wish them all the best and want them to get what they deserve. \"We want them to just enjoy their football. Having been there last year at Barcelona and watching all the players go through the ordeals after the World Cup, [it] was challenging off the pitch for them. It would be nice for them to get back to focusing on their football because they are incredible people and unbelievable players.\" Timeline of events in Rubiales controversy August 20, 2023 - Rubiales kisses forward Hermoso on the lips during World Cup final medal ceremony.

Not even a single night in prison. Just a slap on the wrist and a ticket to carry on your life, like nothing ever happened,\" Keating posted on Instagram. Dean Harte, 22, from Tyrellspass, County Westmeath, collided with Ciar\u00e1n Keating's car while driving near Swinford, County Mayo, in July 2023. He was given a 17-month suspended sentence at Castlebar Circuit Court in Mayo on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to careless driving causing death. In a statement, Ronan Keating described the the sentencing as \"devastating\" and said the Keating family will be \"encouraging the DPP to appeal and rightfully fight for justice\". RT\u00c9 Harte's Audi A3 crashed into Mr Keating's Ford Focus and the 57-year-old died at the scene On the day of the crash, Ciar\u00e1n Keating and his wife Annemarie, who was also seriously injured in the crash, had been travelling to watch their son play football. The court heard how Harte failed to take a bend on a stretch of the N5 between Swinford and Bohola. Harte's Audi A3 crashed headlong into Mr Keating's Ford Focus and the 57-year-old died at the scene. The court was told nobody was speeding during the incident. 'Shame on everyone involved' Writing on social media, the singer described the the sentencing as \"devastating\" and said the Keating family will be \"encouraging the DPP to appeal\". \"We wonder why we keep seeing this kind of behaviour on our roads, why people keep dying in road accidents across Ireland every week? \"It's a joke and it's morally corrupt that rather than trying to fix our broken system, they all turn a blind eye. \"Shame on Dean Harte but more so, shame on everyone involved in this process that contributed to the heart-breaking outcome for my family. \"The Lord himself knows the injustice that was served and the Keating family will never find peace. \"We will continue to fight for Ciar\u00e1n's justice. At this time we think of all the other families who have found themselves in our position, and we pray that other families never do.\" The Keating Family added: \"The only way to stop reckless driving and encourage people (especially youth) to abide by the law, is to enforce consequences for not doing so.\" Republic of Ireland Related Man in court in Belfast accused of Dublin stab murder 2 hrs ago Europe Sinn F\u00e9in to boycott White House St Patrick's Day celebrations 2 hrs ago Northern Ireland Politics New Look set to exit Republic of Ireland market 24 hrs ago Europe British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info Contact technical support Copyright 2025 BBC.

July 30, 2022. Share Rwanda says DRC criticism of Arsenal, Bayern and PSG deals threatens regional peace share Print London \u2014 Rwanda on Thursday described recent criticism of its Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain football sponsorship deals by the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s foreign minister as a threat to regional peace and stability. Earlier this month, DRC's foreign minister, Therese Kayikwamba Wagner, urged the three prominent European clubs to end their \"blood-stained\" sponsorship agreements with \"Visit Rwanda,\" questioning the morality of such partnerships while fighting raged in eastern Congo. Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized key parts of eastern DR Congo in recent weeks, in what is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources. \"The Government of Rwanda rejects recent attempts by the Democratic Republic of Congo to undermine Rwanda\u2019s international partnerships through misinformation and political pressure,\" Rwanda Development Board, which oversees the deals, said in a statement on Thursday. \"These efforts not only misrepresent the truth but also threaten the foundations of regional peace, stability, and economic cooperation that we have worked tirelessly to build.\" Congo's foreign affairs minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on WhatsApp. The fighting in eastern Congo has led to human rights violations including summary executions, the bombing of displacement camps, reports of gang rape and other sexual violence, according to the United Nations. Rwanda says it is defending itself, accusing Congo's military of joining forces with ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda, where Hutus targeted Tutsis in a 1994 genocide and some of them later fled to Congo. \"Visit Rwanda\" began their sponsorship of Arsenal in 2018, with the latest deal reported to be worth more than $12 million per year. Bayern Munich signed a five-year football development and tourism promotion partnership with Rwanda in 2023, while \"Visit Rwanda\" has been a sponsor of PSG since 2019. Reuters previously contacted the three clubs about the sponsorship deals but none replied.

The day after the Reds' 2-2 draw at Aston Villa, Slot spoke to reporters at the AXA Training Centre to preview this Sunday's encounter against Pep Guardiola's side. See the key takeaways from the head coach's briefing\u2026 LFC injury update: Cody Gakpo, Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez On playing after Arsenal this weekend... I think the biggest question to be asked is from Man City because we face a strong team again, like we faced [at] Villa. Yeah, Arsenal plays before us but we know that doesn't make the game easier or more difficult than we have against City. We know we have 12 games to play and Arsenal has 13 games to play. If we constantly look at Arsenal or what other teams are doing, that would not help us. We already know how difficult it is to go to the Etihad, so we don't need Arsenal to get involved in that even more. On what he expects from Man City... What I always expect from City since Pep is there: a great football team that can play so well. They've had maybe one or two months in the seven or eight years he's there now that weren't the best, maybe partly because of injuries as well. Injuries come back, they've signed three or four players, I can see them coming back already if you look at the result against Newcastle. So what you expect is what everybody expects if you go to the Etihad if you play against City. You have to suffer as well and work really hard to keep them away from your goal because they are so, so good in ball possession. But they face a strong team as well that hasn't lost for 22 games. You have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site. Manage Settings Watch on YouTube On Darwin Nunez... I can accept every miss, especially from a player that has scored two very important goals against Brentford, that's scored for us in the home game against Villa. I would prefer him to score but the word 'chance' says it all \u2013 it's a chance, so it's not 100 per cent sure that the ball goes in. Players miss chances, that I can accept. But what was a bit harder for me to accept [was] his behaviour after that chance, and with behaviour I mean I think it got too much in his head where he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his [backside] off and makes sure he helps the team. I think he was too disappointed after missing that chance and maybe \u2013 we will never know, we will never find out \u2013 that's why he was just a fraction short [in] the moment afterwards. I always truly believe that it's always the best to have Wata [Wataru Endo]'s mindset and what I mean with that is that for the whole season he just keeps on going, keeps on going, keeps on going and whenever we need him, he's ready. That is very difficult, there are not many players that can do this. It's not about the chance for me, it's more about the 20 minutes afterwards where I want to talk to him about than about him missing a chance. On what he's learning about his players at this stage of the season... You always learn in every game but I see mostly the same things. So, these players are able to play every three days on the best of their capabilities in terms of physique. If you saw yesterday again, I mostly take Dom Szoboszlai as an example \u2013 what a work-rate for his third game in a row. Until the last, last second, he kept on running up and down, up and down, up and down. That's the only thing I can ask for and what the fans can ask for. And that we are then unlucky not to score our chances, that's football unfortunately. But we cannot accept \u2013 not the fans, nor me \u2013 that they don't give maximum effort. But that's what they constantly do and I assume that they will do again. But you never know the outcome because we face \u2013 with Villa, with Everton away \u2013 difficult opponents. The fixture list for us now is a few difficult ones in a row \u2013 that's what you have to accept. The good thing is that we are not behind someone, we are still number one and that's the good thing if you go into a run of games like this. On Ryan Gravenberch's form.. . I think that is partly what it is [that he can't be nine out of 10 every game]. There are only a few players in the world that can be a nine or a 10 every single three days. If you look at his age, he might, might, might eventually belong to those group of players \u2013 those two or three or four that can do this. But he's not there yet, which is completely normal and it depends also on the playing style of the opponent, which we just said. If you play Everton or Wolves, that is a completely different game than when you play Villa. I liked him yesterday much more than I liked him against Everton, for example. It's not always as simple as the form of a player or how many games did he play, but nine or 10 times that's the most easy reason to give instead [of] diving into looking at playing style and certain other things. \u200c On Diogo Jota's impact since returning from injury and whether he'll be disappointed at not scoring more than once... Probably he will, although apart from him hitting the target he gave a great assist as well [against Villa], so it tells you maybe more how disappointed I am that we missed him for four to five months. It tells you that something changed in our playing style. When he was there with us before, I think he was involved in a lot of goals \u2013 scoring as well \u2013 so it tells you how much of a miss it has been not to have him. But again, I would have loved to have played him every single time for maybe 90 minutes, but if a player is out for four or five months and he hasn't been out out, he has been coming back, coming in, coming back and every time we played him a bit too much he got injured again, I hope people understand why we are so cautious now. Because [with] 12 games to go, you tell me \u2013 and I see the same \u2013 how much of a threat he is, so we have to keep him available for 12 more games and Champions League and the League Cup final. That is not an easy balance to find. I would have loved to have kept him in the team because he played really well, for Trent [Alexander-Arnold] the same. Who takes out two players that are playing so well? That's only because it is a big injury risk to keep them in the team. When I drove in, I was listening to talkSPORT and Mark Lawrenson, he couldn't simply understand why I took Trent off, which I understand from his perspective because he played so well and he just scored a goal, but now maybe he does. On managing Alexander-Arnold's minutes... We spoke about this already a week ago, that in these five games he already knows how many minutes he would make. That was in a situation where Conor [Bradley] was available as well. Now we maybe have to adjust our plan. I said to him, 'You know why I take you off, don't you?' He said, 'Yeah, we spoke about it.' But, of course, a player has adrenaline and had just scored. It was a better moment than against Wolves when he lost the ball just before I took him off. He is improving.

        "extracted_content": "Iowa football could see seismic shifts in new Big Ten, SEC scheduling Schedule Football Basketball Women's Basketball Recruiting Odds Newsletter FOOTBALL Impacts of proposed Big Ten, SEC scheduling agreement on Iowa football Riley Donald Hawkeyes Wire The way college football used to be continues to look like it will be a thing of the past as the sport changes more and more with each passing day. With rumored discussions of College Football Playoff expansions opening the door for more teams to make their way into the field, some dominos must fall with that. One of those major dominos is the future of how teams will schedule their seasons and what that could mean for teams like the Iowa Hawkeyes. With a proposed new plan, it could mean that the Hawkeyes would end their regular season with a potential College Football Playoff play-in game against an SEC school. Per Dellenger, the proposed changes would \u201cclear the way\u201d for the SEC to begin playing nine regular season conference games, which would then have a knock-on effect to other parts of the schedule. Primarily, a ninth conference game would trigger a likely scheduling agreement with the Big Ten that would pit the two conference\u2019s schools against each other for one game each season (similar to cross-conference competitions seen in college basketball). The games would then be sold as a separate television package, generating yet more revenue for the two conferences as schools scramble for ways to pay players in college football\u2019s new era. These wouldn't be bowl games or anything, but rather would be played in the same weekend that conference championships were regularly held. This weekend would act as a time for play-in games to occur. Iowa, a team near the top of the Big Ten, but not usually winning it, could be a program that this directly impacts more than most as they are routinely on the cusp of College Football Playoff contention. An expanded playoff would also have a drastic impact on conference championship weekend. According to the report, conferences would begin considering turning championship weekend into a \u201cplay-in\u201d format of sorts. For example, the SEC or Big Ten \u2014 with their four automatic berths each \u2014 could pit their third-seeded team against their sixth-seeded team, and their fourth team against the fifth, in play-in games that determine who receives an automatic bid into the CFP. This weekend could see the Hawkeyes lining up against a team from the SEC with a spot in the College Football Playoff on the line. Iowa could be on the cusp of the playoff field and be playing a game against an SEC team that has the same thing on the line. While this is a rumored proposal, the changes would still be at least a year or two away from being implemented as the ESPN TV deal runs through 2025 and no changes would occur until a new one is struck.

And who 'wins' the Wooden Spoon? Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Wales were the most recent recipients of the Wooden Spoon Emma Middleton BBC Sport journalist Published 20 February 2025 Many are steeped in history, but not all come with bragging rights. Here's a look at the various Six Nations awards and accolades. What is the Triple Crown? The Triple Crown is contested by England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Should one of those teams beat the other three, they win the Triple Crown. Though not named as such then, it was first awarded - to England - back in 1883 at the inaugural Home Nations Championship (the forerunner to the Six Nations). Before 2006 there was no actual trophy, and it was referred to as the 'invisible cup'. The most successful team in the Six Nations era (from 2000) are Ireland, with seven Triple Crowns. They will win it again should they beat Wales. Scotland have yet to win the Triple Crown since the competition expanded to six teams in 2000 - they last won it in 1990. Do France and Italy play for a trophy? Yes - the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy. That is a much newer addition to the Six Nations - it was introduced in 2007. The trophy is named after an Italian general who was famous for the role he played in the unification of Italy. Italy have only won the trophy twice - in 2011 and 2013. What is a Grand Slam? To win a Grand Slam, teams must win all five matches of their Six Nations campaign. Ireland achieved the feat most recently - in 2023. While the Six Nations winners do not necessarily have to win a Grand Slam, any team winning a Grand Slam will win the overall tournament. That is because of the Six Nations bonus points system, which awards three extra points to a team that wins all of their matches. France and Wales have won the most Grand Slams (four) of the Six Nations era. What is the Calcutta Cup? The Calcutta Cup is the oldest trophy in international rugby, contested by England and Scotland. As its name suggests, the cup originated in India in the late 19th century, at a Calcutta rugby club formed of British expats. After the rugby club disbanded, the remaining members decided to melt down the club's remaining funds, creating a trophy made out of rupees. The trophy was then given to the Rugby Football Union (RFU). It was in 1879 that England and Scotland first competed for the Calcutta Cup. When the BBC broadcast the Calcutta Cup match in 1938, it was the first live televised rugby international. To date, England have won 82 of the 130 matches played , external - but Scotland have been dominant in recent years, having won the past four. Who 'wins' the Wooden Spoon? 'Winning' the Wooden Spoon isn't something to celebrate. And, no, there's no actual spoon involved. The metaphorical award goes to the team who finish bottom of the table. The idea of awarding a 'wooden spoon' is thought to trace back to the University of Cambridge, where one was given to the student who scored the lowest grade in a maths exam. The term has been used in rugby since the late 19th century. Only England and Ireland have avoided the wooden spoon in the Six Nations era, with Italy 'winning' it most. More questions answered...

That applies to players\u2019 contracts, too. The league\u2019s fluid contract structure creates a spectrum where players can have their salaries fully locked in, have a portion of that money in the \u201cno matter what\u201d pile or wind up facing unemployment with little to show for it but a handshake and a \u201cgood luck\u201d from their former team. Combine that range of guaranteed cash with a hard salary cap that\u2019s great for parity but brutal for players and you\u2019ve got an ecosystem where teams weigh veteran stars\u2019 impact against their cost. Each offseason gives all 32 franchises a chance to reset and examine their books. If a player isn\u2019t producing up to his salary, he could wind up on the chopping block, no matter how beloved he may be. 2025 is no exception \u2014 and these 32 players could wind up being prizes in free agency instead of pushing toward Super Bowl 60 with their current teams. Let\u2019s break down one potential cap casualty from each team in alphabetical order. Salary cap savings information is courtesy of the incredibly useful Over the Cap . Arizona Cardinals: RB Michael Carter Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $1,220,000 The Cardinals don\u2019t have too many major cap commitments in their ongoing rebuild and will have plenty of spending room this offseason. Shedding the team\u2019s RB4 (or RB5, depending on how you view Deejay Dallas) would shave another million dollars off the cap. Atlanta Falcons: QB Kirk Cousins Todd Kirkland/Getty Images 2025 cap savings : $0 Cousins is a sunk cost thanks to his frustrating 2024 and Michael Penix Jr.\u2019s place as the team\u2019s franchise quarterback in waiting. Since his physical limitations rip pages out of the Atlanta playbook, there\u2019s little value to keeping him around as an incredibly expensive backup. But since designating him a post-June 1 cut won\u2019t generate any tangible savings, it\u2019s possible he sticks around. Baltimore Ravens: WR Nelson Agholor Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $3,283,000 Agholor\u2019s extension in Baltimore last season was a one-year deal with four voidable years afterward for salary cap purposes. Eliminating those will shave more than $3 million off the team\u2019s salary cap, which starts the 2025 offseason with fewer than $6 million to spend. Buffalo Bills: EDGE Von Miller Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $17,440,000 Designating Miller a post-June 1 release would shave more than $17 million from the team\u2019s salary cap that could be used toward adding veteran wideout talent as Amari Cooper and Mack Hollins test free agency. Miller had a bounce-back 2024, but that resulted in just six sacks while playing less than a third of the team\u2019s defensive snaps. Carolina Panthers: RB Miles Sanders Bob Donnan-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $6,700,000 The Panthers should be accumulating talent, not jettisoning it. But Sanders, who has 939 total yards in two seasons after signing a four-year, $25.4 million contract with Carolina in 2023, wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a player whose impact is missed. Chicago Bears: S Kevin Byard David Banks-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $7,000,000 Chicago has the cap space to avoid any difficult decisions, but is also undergoing a regime change with Ben Johnson taking the reins at head coach. Byard turns 32 in August and his coverage has slipped significantly from his Pro Bowl peak. With a solid class of veteran talent available, the Bears can get younger in their backfield \u2014 and potentially cheaper, too. Cincinnati Bengals: EDGE Sam Hubbard or DT Sheldon Rankins USA Today Sports 2025 cap savings : at least $9,511,765 The Bengals need all the pass rushing help they can get, but both Hubbard and Rankins slogged through awful seasons in 2024 to leave Trey Hendrickson as the team\u2019s only pocket-crumpling threat. With cap space needed to keep Tee Higgins in town (and potentially extend Hendrickson), Cincinnati could generate $19 million in savings by blowing up its front line and starting over with younger, cheaper replacements. Cleveland Browns: OT Jack Conklin Akron Beacon Journal 2025 cap savings : $14,647,059 Conklin is a two-time All-Pro, but he missed nearly the entire 2023 season due to injury and was roughly average in 2024 (12 games). He\u2019ll turn 31 in August. While the Browns would like to keep him, their genuinely terrible salary cap position, made possible by giving Deshaun Watson $230 million fully guaranteed despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct and what the NFL itself described as \u201cpredatory behavior\u201d dating to his time as a Houston Texans, suggests he could be on the chopping block in order to get back under 2025\u2019s spending limit. Dallas Cowboys: OT Terence Steele Andrew Dieb-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $14,000,000 Steele is a perfectly useful tackle, but Dallas is a projected $4.5 million over the 2025 spending limit coming into the offseason and needs to figure out how to extend Micah Parsons. If Jerry Jones\u2019 CeeDee Lamb and Dak Prescott negotiations are any indication, it will mean a record-setting contract that requires a boatload of cap space to execute \u2014 which could spell the end of Steele\u2019s tenure in Texas. Denver Broncos: S P.J. Locke Timothy T Ludwig/Getty Images 2025 cap savings : $4,190,000 Bo Nix\u2019s rookie contract means Denver won\u2019t have to make many difficult cuts. Locke could stick around, but the Broncos could stand to upgrade the safety position across from Brandon Jones. Locke\u2019s coverage in 2024 could be frustrating, though he cleaned up some of the tackling issues that dogged his 2023. Detroit Lions WR/ST: Kalif Raymond Detroit Free Press 2025 cap savings : $4,826,471 The Lions don\u2019t have many great cut candidates and have a reasonable amount of spending room ($44 million) this offseason. Raymond is an All-Pro returner and worth his salary, but if push comes to shove he may be the most likely player to be released in a cost saving measure. Green Bay Packers: CB Jaire Alexander Journal Sentinel 2025 cap savings : $17,079,412 Alexander was a cut candidate last season but returned to the lineup for 2024. He played just seven games due to injury and Green Bay still won 11 games without him, suggesting the 28-year-old former All-Pro could be in line for either a pay cut or a release \u2014 though with $42 million to spend this offseason, the Packers won\u2019t be pressured to get either done immediately this offseason. Houston Texans: EDGE Denico Autry Alex Slitz/Getty Images 2025 cap savings : $8,794,118 Autry has no guaranteed money left on his contract and plays a depth role behind Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. in the edge rushing rotation. Houston could bring him back at a lower price, but with a cap crunch looming the veteran defender is an obvious candidate to be let go. Indianapolis Colts: OT Braden Smith Jenna Watson-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $16,750,000 General manager Chris Ballard kept the band together in 2024 and was rewarded with regression and the distinct feeling his job is on the line this fall. That could spur dramatic moves like releasing Smith, who\u2019d generate significant savings but eliminate a steady contributor from the starting lineup. Smith has only played 22 games the last two seasons and is nearing 30. Cutting him may not be at the top of Ballard\u2019s to-do list, but if he needs a bunch of cap space in a hurry it could be the shake-up he needs to prove he\u2019s still capable of big swings. Jacksonville Jaguars: TE Evan Engram Bob Self/Florida Times-Union 2025 cap savings : $15,485,294 Only two players would generate more than $5 million in cap savings for the Jags this offseason via release \u2014 Engram and wideout Christian Kirk. Engram, who turns 31 in September, regressed after his breakthrough 2023 and his 1.67 yards per route run were 16th in the NFL among tight ends \u2014 behind 14th place Brenton Strange, who Jacksonville selected in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft. Kansas City Chiefs: WR Skyy Moore Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $1,584,615 A Travis Kelce retirement would shave more than $17 million from the team\u2019s books this offseason. The only other veteran who\u2019d clear more than $4 million in cap space is Joe Thuney, who isn\u2019t going anywhere. Releasing Moore won\u2019t bring much spending room back to the coffers, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt the offense much either. Las Vegas Raiders: QB Gardner Minshew Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $9,340,000 Minshew is making reasonable money for a high level backup who can fill in as a reasonable lower-tier starter in a pinch. But Aidan O\u2019Connell is cheaper and the Raiders are looking to move in a different direction with Pete Carroll in as head coach and Tom Brady taking a bigger role in ownership decisions. Los Angeles Chargers: EDGE Joey Bosa Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $25,360,000 The Chargers have plenty of spending room and do not need to move on from Bosa. But let\u2019s look at the reality; Bosa is almost 30 and has played only 28 games the last three seasons. His 11.3 percent pressure rate was the lowest of his career and his 33 pressures ranked tied for 85th in the league last season. Los Angeles should not release its five-time Pro Bowler, but if the finances were different Jim Harbaugh and company may have been staring down a difficult decision this offseason. Los Angeles Rams: WR Cooper Kupp Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $15,000,000 Kupp has already been cleared to seek out a trade partner, which seems to portend the end of a stellar career in Los Angeles. But designating him a post-June 1 release would leave about as much dead space on the team\u2019s 2025 cap ($14.7 million) as it saves, which could keep him on the roster if no deal is worked out this spring. Miami Dolphins: RB Raheem Mostert The Tennesseean 2025 cap savings : $3,065,000 Miami already told Mostert he\u2019d be released after averaging just 3.3 yards per carry last fall. The soon-to-be 33-year-old will be replaced by Jaylen Wright in the running back rotation. Minnesota Vikings: G Ed Ingram Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $3,325,000 Ingram slipped out of the starting lineup, but Dalton Risner\u2019s free agency clears a path for him to rise back to the top of the depth chart. But a $3.7 million salary is a big ask for a player who struggled through 2024 and isn\u2019t inside the circle of trust this offseason. New England Patriots: WR Kendrick Bourne Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $6,300,000 New England has more salary cap space than anyone headed into 2025. Even so, Bourne\u2019s lack of contributions (28 catches in 2024) could see him erased from a receiving room crowded with depth candidates but few proven starters. New Orleans Saints: EDGE Cameron Jordan Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $11,000,000 To no one\u2019s surprise, New Orleans enters another offseason with the league\u2019s worst salary cap situation. Jordan is a Saints staple, but he has just six sacks the last two seasons combined (34 games) and his 6.7 percent pressure rate at age 35 was the worst of his career. New York Giants OT Jermaine Eluemunor Bill Streicher-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $6,441,176 Eluemunor is a serviceable swing tackle with no guaranteed money left on his contract. The Giants have the cap space to keep him around, but could opt for younger, higher-ceiling blockers in his stead. New York Jets: WR Davante Adams Ed Mulholland-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $36,160,000 The Jets already did some of our heavy lifting by informing Aaron Rodgers he won\u2019t be back to 2025. Adams, set to cost nearly $38 million against the team\u2019s cap, could follow his former quarterback out the door despite a solid 2.14 yards per route run \u2014 29th best in the NFL last season. Philadelphia Eagles: CB James Bradberry Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $4,724,000 Bradberry is 31 years old and didn\u2019t play a single game in 2024 \u2014 and the Eagles won a Super Bowl without him. Letting him go will carve out some of the space needed to retain free agents like Josh Sweat or Milton Williams if that\u2019s what general manager Howie Roseman decides. Pittsburgh Steelers LB Cole Holcomb Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $6,000,000 Pittsburgh seems content to roll with Patrick Queen and Payton Wilson at off-ball linebacker. Holcomb missed the entire 2024 season and could stick around as a depth option this fall, but his high price could leave a Steelers team in search of an established quarterback to jettison him to the open market. San Francisco 49ers: DT Javon Hargrave Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports 2025 cap savings : $2,232,353 The Niners have already indicated they\u2019d let Hargrave go two seasons into a four-year, $84 million deal. He played just three games in 2024 but was a Pro Bowler in 2023. Seattle Seahawks: WR Tyler Lockett Jane Gershovich/Getty Images 2025 cap savings : $17,000,000 Lockett is 32 years old and coming off his least productive season since 2017. With Jaxon Smith-Njigba climbing Geno Smith\u2019s wish list, the veteran wideout may no longer be worth the expense as his route tree dwindles. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: S Jordan Whitehead Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $4,500,000 Whitehead\u2019s production fell off precipitously in his first year in Tampa and there are zero guarantees when it comes to his 2025 salary. While $4.5 million isn\u2019t a lot, the Buccaneers are pressed up against the salary cap and need to find cash to keep standbys like Chris Godwin and Lavonte David in town. Tennessee Titans: LB Kenneth Murray Marc Lebryk-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $7,660,000 The former first round pick failed to pan out with the Chargers and failed to impress in his first season with the Titans \u2014 Pro Football Focus rated him 169th out of 189 qualified linebackers this season. Tennessee can clear about 75 percent of his non-guaranteed 2025 salary from its books by releasing him this spring. Washington Commanders: CB Marshon Lattimore Bill Streicher-Imagn Images 2025 cap savings : $18,000,000 Lattimore was arguably the biggest name dealt at last year\u2019s trade deadline, but he failed to regain his early form in Washington. The Commanders rallied to the NFC title game despite their top cornerback being absent much of the season and torched by guys like Mike Evans and A.J. Brown on the field. His resume and Washington\u2019s cap space suggests he\u2019ll get another chance to course correct, but he was not the inspiring addition the Commanders hoped in 2024. Like this article?

Celle d\u2019un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me domin\u00e9 et dirig\u00e9 par un club surpuissant et son patron aux multiples casquettes. \u00ab Je tiens \u00e0 rendre un hommage particulier \u00e0 Brest, qui a fait honneur \u00e0 la France et au football fran\u00e7ais dans cette campagne de Ligue des champions. Le pr\u00e9sident Le Saint, Yann (Kerdraon), Pascal (Robert), Gr\u00e9gory (Lorenzi) et toute l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Brest construisent quelque chose pour le long terme et nous ont toujours tr\u00e8s bien trait\u00e9s. Ce fut un honneur pour le PSG d\u2019affronter sur le terrain ces deux derni\u00e8res semaines un club dont le football fran\u00e7ais peut \u00eatre fier. \u00bb La d\u00e9claration de Nasser Al-Khelaifi \u00e0 l\u2019issue de PSG-Brest mercredi soir pourrait sembler de bonne foi, si les masques n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tomb\u00e9s quelques heures plus t\u00f4t. En effet, L\u2019\u00c9quipe et France 2 d\u00e9voilaient ce mercredi les coulisses d\u2019une r\u00e9union entre pr\u00e9sidents de clubs de Ligue 1 tenue le 14 juillet dernier au sujet des droits TV , lors de laquelle la mainmise du Qatari sur la gouvernance du football fran\u00e7ais appara\u00eet plus claire que jamais. Entre superpuissance sportive, \u00e9conomique et gouvernance, cette s\u00e9quence raconte bien ce qu\u2019est devenu le football fran\u00e7ais : un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me en crise, dirig\u00e9 selon son bon vouloir par un club et sa direction. \u26bd\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f DOCUMENT EXCEPTIONNEL @Cdenquete Nasser al-Khela\u00effi (PSG) \u00e0 John Textor (OL) : \"Tu es un cowboy qui vient de nulle part et tu viens nous parler ?\" Les images de la r\u00e9union explosive entre les pr\u00e9sidents du foot fran\u00e7ais pour les droits TV de la Ligue 1 \ud83d\udca5 #JT20h pic.twitter.com/wACM1qO1fe \u2014 Le20h-France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions (@le20hfrancetele) February 19, 2025 Tout le monde se couche, ou presque Si les tensions concernant l\u2019attribution des droits TV l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier ne sont un secret pour personne, difficile d\u2019imaginer le pugilat qu\u2019est devenue la r\u00e9union d\u00e9cisive, \u00e0 moins d\u2019un mois de la reprise. Dans le coin gauche, le \u00ab cowboy \u00bb John Textor et le Lensois Joseph Oughourlian, oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la solution du moindre mal incarn\u00e9e par le duo DAZN-Bein Sports. Dans le coin droit, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, extr\u00eamement offensif pour imposer le retour dans le game de la cha\u00eene qatarie, qui plus est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en bon samaritain d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res minutes de la discussion par Vincent Labrune, cantonn\u00e9 au r\u00f4le du laquais. Et au milieu, une majorit\u00e9 silencieuse qui ne dit rien ou presque, dans laquelle s\u2019inscrit notamment Denis Le Saint, pr\u00e9sident brestois gratifi\u00e9 des honneurs du big boss ce mercredi soir. Un silence justifi\u00e9 par une peur des repr\u00e9sailles ? L\u2019attitude et les d\u00e9clarations de Nasser Al-Khelaifi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des deux brebis galeuses, accus\u00e9es de ne rien comprendre \u00e0 la question, peuvent le laisser pr\u00e9sager. \u00ab Tu es bon dans ton business, mais tu ne comprends rien aux m\u00e9dias \u00bb , se permet d\u2019envoyer NAK \u00e0 l\u2019adresse d\u2019Oughourlian, sans oublier d\u2019en garder sous le coude pour Textor, trait\u00e9 de \u00ab cowboy \u00bb venu de \u00ab je ne sais o\u00f9 \u00bb . Qualifi\u00e9 en retour de \u00ab tyran \u00bb qui \u00ab intimide tout le monde \u00bb , le pr\u00e9sident parisien ne s\u2019en laisse pas compter, allant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 menacer de quitter l\u2019appel (et de retirer l\u2019offre de 100 millions d\u2019euros de Bein ?) afin de s\u2019assurer de plier tout le monde \u00e0 sa volont\u00e9. Dans ce contexte ex\u00e9crable, les droits seront donc confi\u00e9s \u00e0 la plateforme britannique, associ\u00e9e \u00e0 Bein, par 16 voix contre 2. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quand la passivit\u00e9 ? Sept mois plus tard, la crise dans laquelle est enfonc\u00e9e le football hexagonal depuis de longues ann\u00e9es n\u2019a fait que s\u2019aggraver, constamment raviv\u00e9e par l\u2019erreur de casting DAZN. Au passage, Vincent Labrune a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement r\u00e9\u00e9lu \u00e0 la t\u00eate de la LFP par des pr\u00e9sidents bien conciliants, et le Qatar, bien que moins enclin \u00e0 faire tourner la planche \u00e0 billets \u00e0 tour de bras, a maintenu son emprise. Bien cach\u00e9 derri\u00e8re son r\u00f4le autoproclam\u00e9 de locomotive, le PSG ne saurait se plaindre d\u2019une situation qui le voit marcher une nouvelle fois sur une Ligue 1 d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat (du moins pour ce qui est de la course au titre) et attirer encore et toujours toute la lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 lui. Y compris en Ligue des champions donc, o\u00f9 la magnifique \u00e9pop\u00e9e brestoise aura \u00e9t\u00e9 torpill\u00e9e par la dure r\u00e9alit\u00e9 nationale . Attention toutefois \u00e0 ne pas devenir l\u2019arme de destruction d\u2019un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me de plus en plus fragile, bien aid\u00e9 par la passivit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Les fuites des \u00e9changes de juillet dernier, dans un contexte o\u00f9 l\u2019entente cordiale avec DAZN vole en \u00e9clats, laissent toutefois imaginer que le temps de la torpeur puisse toucher \u00e0 sa fin. En attendant, sur le terrain, la bande de Luis Enrique peut continuer de jouer au roi du bac \u00e0 sable, tant que ce dernier ne d\u00e9passe pas les fronti\u00e8res hexagonales.

By Admin Martin - 20 February 2025, 12:00 Arsenal is expected to sign a new striker at the end of this season, and fans have high expectations for the quality of the player that will arrive. Given their previous struggles in securing a top-class goalscorer, the Gunners can ill afford to make a subpar signing. With a host of top strikers reportedly on their radar, they must carefully consider which one will best fit their squad and their needs. The four names currently on Arsenal\u2019s shortlist are Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres, Alexander Isak, and Mateo Retegui. Each of these strikers brings something unique to the table, but the question remains: which one should Arsenal target to become their next number nine? Long-term Arsenal target Osimhen is undoubtedly one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. The Nigerian has been in excellent form for Napoli, with his impressive goal tally making him one of the top forwards in the world. Despite spending this season on loan at Galatasaray, he has continued to shine, scoring 14 goals and providing four assists in 18 league games. His record suggests he would be a natural fit for the Premier League, where his pace and clinical finishing could make an instant impact at the Emirates. Another player linked with Arsenal is Viktor Gyokeres has also been in exceptional form. The Swedish striker has scored the most goals by any player across the top leagues in 2024, finding the back of the net 22 times in just 21 league games for Sporting Club this season. His remarkable consistency could make him an excellent addition to the Gunners\u2019 attacking line. His ability to score in various ways makes him a versatile option, one that could help Arsenal in different situations. Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting CP . (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) Alexander Isak, who has been linked consistently with Arsena l, is already familiar with the Premier League, which could make his transition to Arsenal smoother. With 17 goals from 23 league games, he has proven himself as a reliable scorer in England\u2019s top flight. His adaptability and experience in the league could be a big advantage for Arsenal, ensuring they don\u2019t have to wait for him to adjust to the demands of Premier League football. Lastly, Mateo Retegui has caught Arsenal\u2019s eye after an impressive start to life at Atalanta. The Argentine striker has netted 20 goals in his first 23 league games this season, showing he has an eye for goal and the ability to perform at a high level in Italy\u2019s Serie A. While he is newer to the European top leagues compared to the other options, his explosive form suggests he has a lot of potential and could be a fantastic addition to Arsenal\u2019s squad. With these four options in mind, it\u2019s clear that each striker brings something different to the table. However, Arsenal must weigh their needs carefully: do they want the proven quality of Osimhen, the impressive form of Gyokeres, the Premier League experience of Isak, or the promising talent of Retegui? Whichever choice they make, it\u2019s clear that securing a top striker should be a priority for the club if they are to continue challenging for major honours in the future. ADMIN COMMENT So here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow\u2026. You agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.

But it seems Arteta only wants Sesko which is still a promising talent and yet to prove his goal scoring prowess. Hopefully, Arteta is proved right and his belief in Sesko yields results. So it\u2019s looking like Sesko and Zubimendi so far for the summer. Let\u2019s see the rest in comings that will follow in the summer. Arteta just have to get this summer window right this time. Reply Gunsmoke says: February 20, 2025 at 1:21 pm Osimhen is an attack bully who\u2019s is brave and lethal Reply foreverinourshadows says: February 20, 2025 at 3:53 pm So why is he playing in an inferior league? Reply Highlight Thread dgr8xt says: February 20, 2025 at 5:07 pm So anyone playing in an inferior league isn\u2019t good right? Aside from Haaland and Isak, who is comparable to him in the entire premier league? Reply Highlight Thread SJ says: February 20, 2025 at 6:13 pm Osimhen helped win Napoli there first title in over 30+ years with 26 league goals. He had an issue with the Napoli board so he was loaned to Galatasary because the fee they put on him was way too high. Reply Highlight Thread Andrew Elder says: February 20, 2025 at 1:32 pm Don\u2019t bother with Isak, the Magpies are looking for over \u00a3100m for him. I think MA will stick with Havertz. Reply DEREK says: February 21, 2025 at 10:46 am Andrew Elder, If Arteta doe\u2019s stick with Havertz at the expense of bringing in a proper striker along with more attacking player\u2019s then he must definitely go. Reply Highlight Thread Jax says: February 20, 2025 at 1:56 pm I\u2019ve only seen Isak & Gyokeres play, so can\u2019t pass judgment, but I\u2019d be surprised if we bought any of these if we\u2019re in competition for them. We seem to like a clear field for transfers. Reply neil says: February 20, 2025 at 10:39 pm hence Sesko ! Zubimendi to take over from Partey over next season.. Partey to head to Saudi in Jan Reply Highlight Thread Wale Akinlatun says: February 20, 2025 at 2:35 pm Osihmen all the way. He\u2019s not just a proven goalscorer but a team player as well. His hold up play is fantastic and the merchandise from his shirt sales will be massive Reply Quantic Dream says: February 20, 2025 at 6:50 pm I would love to have Gyokeres, then Osimhen 2nd choice. The one I really don\u2019t want is Sesko whose stats are just like Havertz.. certainly not bad but not great either. We might even get Osimhen for a cut-price \u00a340M considering they don\u2019t want him at Napoli and he is also desperate to leave. In fact, Osimhen will be the easiest to sign. Reply Joe. S says: February 20, 2025 at 8:51 pm Anyone but Regui. Having seen this guy play for Italy, I can only say this guy is nothing. . Reply The Shoba Reality Show says: February 21, 2025 at 4:16 am Mikel wants Sesko, and Sesko may not want to come. That suits Mikel\u2019s strategy well as he has to play Gabby till 2027 as he is on mammoth wages with little to no output, and other clubs are not easily conned. Next he has the 65M dollar man, who will be benched if we get a true CF. Mikel knows best \u2013 Gabby cannot play 5 games on a run, so Kai starts the next 33. Problems solved! The owners are not keen to win big jugs \u2013 the preseason Emirates Cup and \u201cWenger\u2019s Top Four Trophy\u201d are enough for them. You may note that once Mr. Wenger dropped out of the top 4, he was replaced. Emery did not make it to top 4, he was replaced. If Mikel can deliver this trophy year after year, his job is safe (he could even beat Mr.Wenger\u2019s 22 year stint) Reply SueP says: February 21, 2025 at 6:28 am Neither Emery or AW were replaced directly after finishing below 4th. Reply Highlight Thread The Shoba Reality Show says: February 21, 2025 at 7:39 am Its no coincidence that AW left after 2 failed top 4 attempts during the season when he was a man of principles who would \u201chonor\u201d his contract. Emery narrowly missed top4 in his first season, the second season he was well off the mark for the coveted top 4 trophy. He too would not \u201cleave\u201d his job without another. Reply Highlight Thread SueP says: February 21, 2025 at 8:31 am I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t get your point The board didn\u2019t sack either manager for finishing outside the top 4 just once. They acted after a second season with AW \u2013 in no small part because of fan pressure and in Emery\u2019s case he was heavily backed in the transfer window but the expected quick fix didn\u2019t materialise. Reply Highlight Thread The Shoba Reality Show says: February 21, 2025 at 10:13 am Depends on how one perceives the situation \u2013 both managers did not last after losing out (Mr Wenger) and on the verge of losing (Mr. Emery) the prestigious top 4 trophy. As long as Mikel delivers top 4, his job is safe. So, I have lowered my expectations, and watch the games if I have no other productive work to do. Since Mikel nor the players or the owners have any ambition to win silverware (other than CL qualification). One day they smash City 5-1 and go down to NU in the semis or lose to the worst MU team in history \u2013 does not make sense to me. I feel cheated. Nevertheless, i have no grudge against the club or anyone, and wish them all the best. If they can overturn a 5 point EPL lead and win the UCL, then it would signal ambition by Mikel and the team. How can senior players earning 1000s of pounds per week fail to deliver in a crunch semis is beyond comprehension when a common man can be fired for not working his shift when he ears a meagre few pounds an hour.

If the rumours regarding his attitude are untrue, and if MA thinks our medical team can solve his injury issues, Osimhen would be a clear cut option for me. Although what makes me feel that the attitude issues are a real thing is due to not much interest in his signing when he was made available by Napoli. Reply DEREK says: February 21, 2025 at 10:49 am Kia, With his injury prone nature, he should fit right in at our club won\u2019t he.\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d Reply Highlight Thread gizzle says: February 21, 2025 at 11:27 am @DEREK What injury record, I hate people on a bandwagon especially when they discuss on African players, Osimhen was more fit than Haaland last season . Reply Highlight Thread DEREK says: February 21, 2025 at 12:03 pm gizzle, I don\u2019t know if you miss understand me or not. I was joking, its called a sense of humour, something that some people don\u2019t appear to have. \ud83d\ude44 Reply Highlight Thread gizzle says: February 21, 2025 at 11:32 am @Kia What attitude? World-class players have personalities. Osimhen has no attitude; that is made up by Arsenal PR not to sign the player. The injury-prone discussion is even funnier. Is Havertz injury-prone? lol . Nobody signed Gyokeres from Sporting; was it his attitude that led to the lack of interest? Last but not least, after what Laurentis did to Osimehn, we should all hail Victor for handling the situation with class. I have never seen when a club is racist toward its own player. There was interest from MAnU; the player didn\u2019t want to go, Chelsea wanted to sign but couldn\u2019t meet his pay, Saudi came calling, and Laurentis wanted more money at the last minute, and even when all this happened, Gala still got him. Kindly find out more on the player before making comments on him Reply Highlight Thread reddb10 says: February 21, 2025 at 9:35 am Either Sesko or Gyokeres would be perfect. We should stay away from Isaak because as with any player already in the PL the price will be astronomical. Reply gizzle says: February 21, 2025 at 11:36 am @reddb10 . Kindly go watch Sesko play , he isnt even the best striker on his team . Reply Highlight Thread gunnerforlife says: February 21, 2025 at 10:17 am I think the wages of Osimhen are too high for Arsenal to fit into their wage category and Isak seems to prefer a move to Barcelona. So the realistic options are gyokeres and Reteigui and I would prefer Gyokeres. Reply gizzle says: February 21, 2025 at 11:35 am @gunnerforlife HAvertz is on 280k a week. Currently, Osimhen is on 215k a week. lol Why do people lie a lot about this player? Reply Highlight Thread DEREK says: February 21, 2025 at 12:06 pm gizzle, You wouldn\u2019t be Osimhen\u2019s agent by any chance would you.\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d Reply Highlight Thread Kia says: February 21, 2025 at 1:17 pm Beat me to it!! \ud83d\ude09 Reply Highlight Thread Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Wales' qualification for the Euros was sealed dramatically. There was high emotion in what was at times a crazy play-off finale in Dublin as Wales edged out the Republic of Ireland in December. It achieved two great things and put Wales into great positions, but they cannot go back from the level they're now at. Firstly they qualified for Euro 2025 - a first major tournament for Wales' women - and secondly it promoted Wales to the top tier of the Nations League. League A, the elite, the top 16 European teams, including World Champions Spain, England, France and Netherlands to name a few. Women's football fixtures Get Sky Sports or stream with NOW At the Euros and the upcoming Nations League, only Iceland has a smaller population and therefore player pool than Wales. But the Wales management, players and indeed the FAW executive don't want to hear the 'little ol' Wales' tag anymore.

Image: Wales are heading to Euro 2025 where they will face England, France and Netherlands As Wales prepare to face Italy and Sweden in their opening Nations League games there is so much that manager Rhian Wilkinson and her staff need to and want to learn. Indeed, if knowledge could be soaked up with sponges then Wales would have bought out any large supermarket stock. It's a learning curve, but the learning has to be mighty quick. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Wales Women continue their preparation for what will be a massive 2025. They play their first matches of the year next week as they look ahead to their first appearance at a women's European Championship Performances or results? It's probably 50.1 per cent to performance so that Wales are ready to go for the Euros in their opening game against the Netherlands, but results can't just be given up in the Nations League. Wilkinson will demand of her players to fight and learn (use those knowledge sponges!) quickly! Wales can't be rolled over by Italy, Sweden or Denmark. It would be morale sapping to head to the Euros after a hiding in the Nations League. So, what have Wales got to avoid this? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports senior reporter Geraint Hughes was in Dublin after Wales women booked their place at this summer's Euros in Switzerland A moment in time, in history where a group of players are genuinely talented. Perhaps compare this Wales class of 2025 with their male compatriots of 2016, with Bale and Ramsey at their peak. Wales Women have a legend of the game in their midst in Jess Fishlock, but along with that seriously good experienced pros like captain Angharad James, Rachel Rowe and Hayley Ladd. Mix in younger players, teenagers like Mared Griffiths and Mayzee Davies who at 17 and 18 years old have got Manchester Utd and Manchester City swiftly bringing them into their first teams. There is a pool of talent now that Wales have not had before. Image: Carrie Jones celebrates victory against Republic of Ireland Add to that, no one really knows the potential of Wales, certainly no one outside Wales does, and that's a huge advantage for 2025. Wales love the underdog tag, they also love a shock. The balancing act for Wales' manager Rhian Wilkinson is to unleash the untried and unknown to try to cause mayhem and panic among opponents, while also learning and adapting to play more like an established side like an England. Whatever, it'll be fun as the Wales group always seem to be smiling, enjoying the moment and planning for that shock. A \u00a31,000,000 SUPER 6 WINNER!

The mission is called STARI-STarlight Acquisition and Reflection toward Interferometry-and will showcase the viability of a new technique for studying exoplanets, or planets outside of our solar system. The technique could be used in the future to better understand whether any of the exoplanets we know about are capable of supporting life as we know it. \"We've detected thousands of these planets and most by indirect means-in other words, not directly through the light they emit,\" said John Monnier, a U-M professor of astronomy and leader of the project. \"It's time to change that.\" The grant was awarded by the Astrophysics Research and Analysis program of NASA's Astrophysics Division. Proof of technology STARI itself isn't designed to show us new things about those planets. Rather, it will demonstrate a crucial technology for a powerful technique called interferometry to prove that larger, more expensive future missions can use this approach to look for signs of life on other planets. Interferometry requires multiple satellites, separated by hundreds of yards, maneuvering in precise coordination to bounce starlight between each other. The satellites need to transmit light to each other with pinpoint accuracy while moving and being separated by roughly the length of a football field. It's this level of control and stability that STARI intends to demonstrate using two small satellites called CubeSats. Both of STARI's satellites-named STARI-1 and STARI-2-are about the size of a briefcase. \"The most challenging aspect of the STARI mission will be achieving the precise coordination and control required for formation flying on a CubeSat platform,\" said Gautam Vasisht, a collaborator on the project and a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL. The advantage of using CubeSats is that they cost a small fraction of what it would take to get a larger mission off the ground. Although they can't completely match the performance of bigger, more sophisticated satellites, CubeSats offer a lower cost way to prove components of the technology needed for those larger missions. \"By testing formation flying technologies on a CubeSat platform, STARI paves the way for future missions that could revolutionize our ability to study distant Earth-like planets,\" Vasisht said. \"It's a demonstration of how innovative engineering and a strong collaboration can push the boundaries of what's possible in astronomy.\" In addition to Vasisht of JPL, the team is joined by experts from across the country, led by Simone D'Amico at Stanford University, E.

UC Irvine study explores habitability of exoplanets orbiting white dwarf stars Los Angeles CA (SPX) Feb 18, 2025 A recent study led by Aomawa Shields, associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, suggests that exoplanets orbiting white dwarf stars could be more habitable than previously assumed. The research, published in The Astrophysical Journal, compares the climates of exoplanets orbiting two different types of stars-a hypothetical white dwarf and Kepler-62, a main sequence star similar to the Sun.

Cette d\u00e9cision met fin \u00e0 une longue bataille judiciaire li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019affaire 1xBet et aux all\u00e9gations de trucage de matchs . La sentence, rendue publique r\u00e9cemment, ent\u00e9rine l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019amende de 200.000 dollars initialement retenue contre lui. Sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, Samuel Eto'o a exprim\u00e9 sa joie et sa gratitude en partageant un message inspir\u00e9 du Psaume 23 : \u00ab Quand je marche dans la vall\u00e9e de l\u2019ombre de la mort, Je ne crains aucun mal, car tu es avec moi: Ta houlette et ton b\u00e2ton me rassurent. MERCI \u00c0 Mes Avocats. La Tricherie ne passera que pour un petit moment. \u00bb Ce post, largement partag\u00e9 et comment\u00e9, refl\u00e8te le soulagement du pr\u00e9sident de la Fecafoot apr\u00e8s des mois de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires. Rappelons que cette affaire avait \u00e9clat\u00e9 en 2023, lorsque des all\u00e9gations de conflits d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats et de trucage de matchs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es contre Samuel Eto'o, en lien avec le partenariat controvers\u00e9 entre la Fecafoot et la plateforme de paris en ligne 1xBet. Ces accusations avaient conduit \u00e0 une amende initiale de 200.000 dollars, une d\u00e9cision que le jury d\u2019appel de la CAF a finalement annul\u00e9e, confirmant ainsi l\u2019innocence de Samuel Eto'o. Cette victoire judiciaire est un soulagement non seulement pour Samuel Eto'o, mais aussi pour le football camerounais, qui traverse une p\u00e9riode de turbulences. Elle renforce la position du pr\u00e9sident de la Fecafoot, souvent critiqu\u00e9 mais \u00e9galement soutenu par de nombreux acteurs du sport camerounais. Pour ses partisans, cette d\u00e9cision prouve que les accusations \u00e9taient infond\u00e9es et visant \u00e0 entacher sa r\u00e9putation. Cependant, cette affaire soul\u00e8ve des questions plus larges sur la gouvernance du football africain et les d\u00e9fis auxquels font face ses dirigeants. Samuel Eto'o, ancienne star du football mondial, incarne \u00e0 la fois les espoirs et les d\u00e9fis du football camerounais. Son leadership \u00e0 la t\u00eate de la Fecafoot reste un sujet de d\u00e9bat, mais cette d\u00e9cision de la CAF pourrait marquer un tournant dans son mandat. En conclusion, le blanchiment de Samuel Eto'o par la CAF est une victoire personnelle et institutionnelle. Elle met fin \u00e0 une pol\u00e9mique qui a longtemps pes\u00e9 sur le football camerounais et offre une opportunit\u00e9 de tourner la page pour se concentrer sur les d\u00e9fis sportifs \u00e0 venir. #SamuelEtoo #CAF #Fecafoot #1xBet #FootballCamerounais #Justice #VictoireJudiciaire Lire aussi dans la rubrique SPORT Les + r\u00e9cents 13:17 Mouvement de F\u00e9vrier 2008 au Cameroun:21 f\u00e9vrier 2014 -21 f\u00e9vrier 2025, Remember Charles ATEBA EYENE 12:21 Crash du Boeing 737 de Camair en 1995 : Proc\u00e8s, responsabilit\u00e9s et r\u00e9clamations de 103 milliards de 12:07 Affaire Nkap \u00e0 Maroua : Deux amantes d'un fonctionnaire le tabassent pour dissimulation de salaire 11:26 Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de la Fecafoot contre Marc Brys : Un Bras de Fer Inutile 11:23 Yunus SA et la Jeunesse Camerounaise, ont f\u00eat\u00e9 le 11 F\u00e9vrier SPORT :: les + lus Le camerounais Samuel Eto\u2019o et trois nig\u00e9rians parmi les dix footballeurs les plus riches d\u2019Afrique 23 December 2015 / 210448 Acad\u00e9mie nationale de football : Au travail ! 06 June 2017 / 123284 Samuel Eto\u2019o rach\u00e8te, r\u00e9nove et offre l\u2019Ambassade du Cameroun \u00e0 Washington 27 October 2015 / 120146 Samuel Eto\u2019o bat un record et obtient 40 millions d\u2019Euros 02 December 2015 / 117349 C'\u00e9tait En Direct sur Camer.be Cameroun 5 vs S\u00e9n\u00e9gal 4 : le Cameroun en 1/2 finale 28 January 2017 / 109946 LE D\u00e9BAT Afrique -D\u00e9bat: Pourquoi la crise anglophone persiste au Cameroun? 24 June 2018 / 207694 Divorces dans la diaspora camerounaise en Europe : explications ? 17 June 2018 / 200396 Quand est-ce les Camerounais prendront enfin leurs responsabilit\u00e9s pour la gestion de leur \u00e9quipe? 05 August 2018 / 194251 Afrique : Quel droit \u00e0 l&#39;image pour les d\u00e9funts au Cameroun ? 17 December 2017 / 190926 Canada - Cameroun, Libert\u00e9 de manifestation partisane au Cameroun : Encore une incurie liberticide de Biya Paul ? 22 October 2017 / 187563 POINT DU DROIT La probl\u00e9matique du changement de nom en droit compar\u00e9 20 April 2019 / 191088 Les \u00e9tapes et les frais de proc\u00e9dure du morcellement d&#39;un terrain au Cameroun 18 June 2016 / 131424 L'obtention d'un titre foncier au Cameroun \u00e0 l'issue d'une vente de terrain 26 October 2019 / 125173 Le jugement suppl\u00e9tif de rectification d'acte de naissance au Cameroun 15 June 2019 / 120297 La proc\u00e9dure d'achat d'un terrain titr\u00e9 dans la ville de Yaound\u00e9 04 May 2019 / 118936 partenaire Vid\u00e9o de la semaine \u00e9v\u00e8nement Vid\u00e9o L'actualit\u00e9 en vid\u00e9o il y a une semaine Monny Eka, artiste de Petit Pays et membre des Sans-Visas, n\u2019est plus : d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 Douala 14 Feb 2025 / 4397 Une Camerounaise de 33 ans tu\u00e9e en Suisse : 12 balles pour un crime familial li\u00e9 au racisme 14 Feb 2025 / 3015 Cabral Libii \u00e9chappe \u00e0 un accident en pleine tourn\u00e9e dans l\u2019Adamaoua 14 Feb 2025 / 2327 D\u00e9c\u00e8s de Wawa Moluh Mekou Th\u00e9odore, architecte et homme politique \u00e0 Foumban 14 Feb 2025 / 2131 Paul Biya et Samuel Tony Obam Bikou\u00e9 : Une Reconnaissance Controvers\u00e9e 14 Feb 2025 / 2121 il y a un mois Merhoye Laoumaye : voici l\u2019homme et voil\u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre 21 Jan 2025 / 4486 France-Cameroun : Des travaux remis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e sur une histoire commune (1945-1971) 21 Jan 2025 / 2632 560 millions FCFA de subvention \u00e9tatique pour les clubs de football professionnels 21 Jan 2025 / 2391 Le Conseil Constitutionnel rend une d\u00e9cision controvers\u00e9e dans l'affaire MRC contre ELECAM 21 Jan 2025 / 1989 Fon de Koshin \"Aucun Fon de la r\u00e9gion du Nord-Ouest ne contr\u00f4le un autre village de Fons\" 21 Jan 2025 / 1968 il y a un an Gr\u00e9goire Mbida Arantes, une l\u00e9gende du football camerounais, dans un \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 pr\u00e9occupant 21 Feb 2024 / 5946 Scandale financier \u00e0 la FECAFOOT : Surfactions et Favoritisme Mis en Lumi\u00e8re 21 Feb 2024 / 4139 Entendu 21 Feb 2024 / 3877 Le MRC d\u00e9ment les propos tenus par Henriette Ekw\u00e9 sur Info TV 21 Feb 2024 / 3868 CONDOLEANCES FRATRERNELLES, SINCERE COMPASSION ET SOUTIEN MORAL A LA FAMILLE ATANGANA KOUNA 21 Feb 2024 / 3116 \u00a9 2005 - 2025 Camer.be"

As\u00ed lo define la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola en su segunda acepci\u00f3n. Pero \u00bfde d\u00f3nde procede el t\u00e9rmino? En la figura de Prudencio Reyes encontramos su origen. Casi desde su nacimiento, el f\u00fatbol fue un deporte seguido y admirado. Evidentemente, no se puede comparar con el fen\u00f3meno mundial que es ahora. Ni en lo que refiere al deporte en s\u00ed, ni, por supuesto, a sus aficionados. Tampoco a la actitud de \u00e9stos con sus equipos. De hecho, los aficionados que acud\u00edan a ver un partido de f\u00fatbol lo hac\u00edan como el que va al teatro. En silencio . A disfrutar el espect\u00e1culo. Sin gritos, ni c\u00e1nticos, ni provocaciones al rival... Pero una persona lo cambi\u00f3 todo. Miguel Prudencio Reyes Viola, el Gordo , hab\u00eda nacido en Montevideo, Uruguay, el 28 de abril de 1882. Talabartero de oficio, se hab\u00eda enrolado a Nacional como utillero, acompa\u00f1ando siempre al equipo. Aunque su principal funci\u00f3n era la de hinchar los balones antes de cada encuentro. Pero una vez que el partido arrancaba, se dejaba llevar por su pasi\u00f3n futbol\u00edstica y por Nacional. Eran constantes sus gritos desde la banda para animar al equipo. Especialmente dirigidos a un futbolista, Megula Canthury, el delantero centro del equipo, y por quien sent\u00eda aut\u00e9ntica devoci\u00f3n. Todo ello, recordemos, en una \u00e9poca en la que lo habitual era que los aficionados estuvieran en silencio. Por eso desde el primer momento comenz\u00f3 a llamar la atenci\u00f3n . \u00bfQui\u00e9n es ese? Preguntaban, incr\u00e9dulos, los presentes. \"Es Prudencio, el hincha pelotas de Nacional\", respond\u00edan. \"El hinchador\"... \"Miren c\u00f3mo grita el hincha pelotas\"\u2026 \"Es el hincha\" \u2026 Y lo que inicialmente surgi\u00f3 como algo anecd\u00f3tico, casi motivo de burla, se fue contagiando. Poco a poco algunos espectadores se fueron a\u00f1adiendo a sus gritos. Poco despu\u00e9s, era buena parte de la afici\u00f3n. Al poco, todo el estadio. Evidentemente, cada uno a su manera. No exist\u00edan los c\u00e1nticos que surgir\u00edan a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde entre todas las aficiones. Pero no es menos cierto que desde su irrupci\u00f3n, desde la irrupci\u00f3n de Prudencio Reyes el gordo , todos los aficionados de Nacional comenzaron a sentir la necesitad de gritar para alentar a su equipo. A \u00e9l y a sus compa\u00f1eros en la grada se les conocer\u00eda como hinchada . Y poco a poco aquello se fue extiendo a todo el pa\u00eds, a todo el continente, a todo el planeta\u2026 Se afirma que a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, la producirse en 1911 la escisi\u00f3n de Nacional para dar lugar al Bristol, Prudencio Reyes fue uno de los que abandon\u00f3 el club para unirse al de nueva creaci\u00f3n. Y que tras la desaparici\u00f3n de este \u00faltimo, pas\u00f3 a ser hincha de Pe\u00f1arol . Prudencio Reyes fallecer\u00eda el 7 de febrero de 1948, a la edad de 65 a\u00f1os, en su Montevideo natal. Pero su legado ha quedado para siempre . Pocas figuras en la historia pueden presumir de haber creado un t\u00e9rmino universal y que trasciendo el transcurrir del tiempo. Hace un tiempo, se erigi\u00f3 una estatua en su honor en el Gran Parque Central, el estadio de Nacional, en un acto organizado por la Comisi\u00f3n de Historia y Estad\u00edstica del Club Nacional de Football.

Ciaran Keating, who was the older brother of the former Boyzone singer, died in a car crash in Co Mayo in July 2023. His wife Annemarie was also seriously injured in the crash. Dean Harte, from Tyrellspass in Westmeath, collided with Keating\u2019s car while driving near Swinford in July 2023. He was yesterday given a 17-month suspended sentence at Castlebar Circuit Court in Mayo after he pleaded guilty to careless driving causing death, the Courts Service said. On the day of the crash, Ciaran and Annemarie had been travelling to watch their son play in a football match for Cork City in Sligo. Ronan helped carry the coffin of his brother Ciaran during his funeral in Louisburgh in July 2023. Advertisement Posting on his Instagram stories, the singer said that the sentencing was a \u201cdevastating example\u201d of how \u201cbroken our justice system is\u201d. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ronan Keating (@rokeating) \u201cYou can kill a man\u2026 and you can walk free. Not even a single night in prison. Just a slap on the wrist and a ticket to carry on your life, like nothing ever happened,\u201d he said in a post on Instagram. \u201cAnd then we wonder why we keep seeing this kind of behaviour on our roads, why people keep dying in road accidents across Ireland every week? \u201cIt\u2019s a joke and it\u2019s morally corrupt that rather than trying to fix our broken system, they all turn a blind eye. \u201cShame on Dean Harte but more so, shame on everyone involved in this process that contributed to the heartbreaking outcome for my family. \u201cThe Lord himself knows the injustice that was served and the Keating family will never find peace. \u201cWe will continue to fight for Ciaran\u2019s justice. At this time we think of all the other families who have found themselves in our position, and we pray that other families never do.\u201d Author Press Association Send Tip or Correction Embed this post To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-keating-broken-justice-system-after-suspended-sentence-over-brothers-death-6627986-Feb2025/?embedpost=6627986&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-keating-broken-justice-system-after-suspended-sentence-over-brothers-death-6627986-Feb2025/?embedpost=6627986&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-keating-broken-justice-system-after-suspended-sentence-over-brothers-death-6627986-Feb2025/?embedpost=6627986&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe> Email \u201cRonan Keating hits out at 'broken justice system' after suspended sentence over his brother's death\u201d.

Here's what to know News Sports Counties Business Music Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals SEC A college football commissioner should force Notre Dame into conference, then fire some folks Blake Toppmeyer John Adams USA TODAY NETWORK A great annual offseason debate hinges on whether college football would benefit from an overarching commissioner \u2013 and whether Nick Saban would be the prime choice for the job, if ever created. We agree that a college football commissioner could enact some meaningful, widely popular changes within the sport, but we're not ready to cede this responsibility to Saban, who would foremost look out for coaches. In fact, we're ready to accept the job ourselves. On this edition of \" SEC Football Unfiltered ,\" a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams share the role of college football commissioner, enacting sweeping change that includes forcing Notre Dame into a conference, expanding the College Football Playoff but stripping away automatic bids and restoring some old rivalries. Let's get to their ideas: Expanded playoff, but no automatic bids We're ditching first-round byes, and we're also ditching automatic bids. Certainly, we want none of this nonsense being circulated within the Big Ten and SEC about a conference starting the season with four playoff bids. Nope, you've gotta earn your way in with your performance. We've settled on a 16-team bracket, filled entirely with at-large bids. Build the re\u0301sume\u0301. Earn the bid. Survive the four-round bracket. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Adams likes the 16-team idea better than Toppmeyer, who would prefer 12 or 14 teams, but Toppmeyer compromises on the number in exchange for all bids being filled via at-large selection. Notre Dame must join a conference If the Irish want to be considered for our 16-team playoff, here's the rule: Join a conference. Those in a conference get considered for our playoff. Those not in a conference don't. Five years to play five seasons No more redshirt seasons. No more eighth-year seniors . Athletes, you get five years to play five seasons. Enjoy. Goodbye, spring practice. Hello, OTAs Spring practice is outdated. With the season extending longer because of the expanded playoff, we don't believe the spring practice model allows athletes sufficient time to recover after the season. Winter and spring strength and conditioning can continue, but no traditional practices in the spring. Instead, we favor the NFL-style offseason training activities in the summer, before preseason camp. To make up for the nixing of spring games, we're opening some snippets of preseason camp to the public. Deal with it, paranoid coaches. The NFL invites fans behind the curtain in the preseason. You can, too. 12 teams in a conference. Maximum. We know this pains you to hear it, but we're dumping the lunacy Washington and Rutgers being in the same conference, and putting Washington and Washington State back together. And, we're just getting started. Out with the coast-to-coast conferences. We're reinstalling smaller conferences, with 12 teams max, that will place a premium on rivalries. Reduce cupcake games Games against FCS opponents no longer are permitted. You can schedule one Group of Five opponent, but all other games must be played against Power Four competition. Kent State, make sure your phone ringer is turned on, because you're going to be in high demand as a lone Group of Five cupcake. Eliminate conference commissioners Conference commissioners are the current college sports czars. Now that we're the college football commissioner, though, don't need conference commissioners. Sure, we might need some deputies to help oversee other sports and take some work off our plate, but the best path toward a unified college football includes reducing the power of conference commissioners. Better yet, we're eliminating conference commissioners in favor of \"conference clerks.\" Greg Sankey and Tony Petitti are free to apply for these clerical positions.

By Sarah Brady on February 20, 2025 | Comments Support us! iRunFar may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article. Learn more . David Roche is a long-established short-distance trail runner and mountain runner. That definition was turned on its head in 2024, however, when he broke the 19-year-old Leadville 100 Mile course record , set by the legendary Matt Carpenter , in his 100-mile debut. He then doubled down by winning the 2024 Javelina 100 Mile , earning a coveted Golden Ticket into the 2025 Western States 100 . But who is David Roche when he\u2019s at home? A running coach, husband, dad of two, and a multitasker. When I spoke with him, he shared: \u201cCurrently, I\u2019m feeding Ollie , our six-week-old, a bottle. So, if any of my answers are off, just blame it on that!\u201d We delved into his path into the sport, his training philosophies, and his inquisitive mind \u2014 which frames training and racing as an exercise in problem-solving and a never-ending learning process. David Roche taking the win at the 2024 Leadville 100 Mile in course record time. Photo: Cody Bare Early Years David Roche grew up on the Eastern shore of Maryland. An unlikely starting point for someone who would go on to represent the U.S. in mountain running, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s really known for cornfields as far as the eye can see, and not a hill in sight. Or the biggest hill coming up out of a river would be about 50 feet.\u201d In his rural homestead \u2014 he lived a 25-minute drive from his high school \u2014 he sought and found human connection through the language of sports. He said: \u201cI grew up playing sports, that was the social currency. Baseball was my first love, and then football became what I really pursued heavily in high school.\u201d Roche attended college in New York City to play football, but his career was not to last. He said, \u201cI was a medium-sized fish in a very small pond where I grew up. And then I went to college in New York City, which was a big culture shock, and I was on the football team for just a short time because I realized it was not for me.\u201d His time playing football was still a worthwhile learning curve for Roche and helped him to understand his strengths and weaknesses, as he reflected: \u201cI was very good at training. I think what made me good at football in high school was I loved the process of trying to solve these scientific problems, like, How can I be the best sprinter possible? And so, after I quit, I still wanted to solve other athletic problems. I wanted to be an athlete for life.\u201d Looking for another sport to which he could apply his love of training, Roche turned to cycling. Cycling had played an important role in his youth, as his father competed as a cyclist, and he had fond memories of watching the daily recaps of stages of the Tour de France during summers at home. He said, \u201cI was always the type to shoot big shots, so I thought, I\u2019m going to become a professional cyclist. Although Roche did show some ability in the sport and quickly trained up to a reasonable level, he admitted: \u201cI did not have good bike handling skills. I got in enough crashes early on in bike racing to think, This isn\u2019t the answer either. \u201d David Roche getting in some bike miles, which he still uses for cross training. Photo: David Roche Discovering Running When Roche discovered running in his sophomore year of college, he felt he could finally call off the search. He shared: \u201cThat became my new love \u2026 I liked that this was something I could improve at \u2026 just starting the process of putting down some bricks.\u201d Running quickly became his primary sport, but Roche kept up some biking alongside it for a time and competed in duathlons. As he was still living in New York City, trail running was yet to find Roche, and he competed first on the roads. He recalls that he first learned about trail running by reading blogs by Anton Krupicka and other prominent trail runners of the time, but it would be some years before he would try it for himself. When eventually he dipped his toe in trail running \u2014 signing up for a trail race in Pennsylvania on a whim with his dad \u2014 he was immediately sold on this new discipline of running. He said: \u201c[Road racing] was so hard. Often, I would get sick after, my stomach would get really bad, I even had to go to the hospital once. But then I did a trail race and was like, This is true play .\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019d always loved training, but I didn\u2019t love the competing part, and this was the first time I loved the competing part. So, I was like, Trail running is where it\u2019s at .\u201d Solving the Puzzle of Ultrarunning Along with discovering the trails, Roche points to meeting his wife Megan Roche in 2010 as a major turning point in his running life. He recalled, \u201cFrom there, it took off. I think it was having someone who greenlit these crazy ambitions that seemed so unrealistic.\u201d Roche raced prolifically and continued to research and experiment with training methods in order to learn and grow as an athlete. His work paid off, and in 2012, he won the USATF 10k Trail National Championships and was awarded the 2014 USATF Trail Runner of the Year sub-ultramarathon distance award. In 2014, both he and Megan \u2014 who had just been married \u2014 were selected to represent Team USA at the 2014 Mountain Running World Championships , but a disappointing race for each of them prompted them to try something different. He recalled: \u201cWe both had had days we weren\u2019t super thrilled with, and the USATF 50k Trail National Championships were at the Flagline 50k in Oregon, and we were in California, and we said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just drive up there?\u2019 Megan had barely gone over 16 miles at that point.\u201d Roche finished just off the podium in fourth and surprised himself with how much he enjoyed going longer. David and Megan Roche on Team USA at the 2014 Mountain Running World Championships. Photo courtesy of David Roche. He confessed to having been guilty of pigeon-holing himself as a short-distance runner and shared: \u201cI always thought that I was a faster twitch athlete who would always suffer the longer the race got \u2026 Breaking down that assumption was something that would take me a decade.\u201d A major shift that helped him master longer distances was getting to grips with high-carb fueling. He said: \u201cWith hindsight, what I\u2019d felt in all my previous races was bonking \u2014 glycogen depletion. I have quite a high burn rate, just because of my physiology, and it took the science progressing about that to realize that all these training principles need to interact with fueling principles.\u201d In 2014, Roche also began coaching, which he described as \u201cmy calling, even more than being an athlete.\u201d Together with wife Megan, the couple has since expanded their coaching business, which is now called SWAP Running \u2014 the acronym meaning \u201cSome work, all play.\u201d Roche continued to rack up wins at sub-ultra distances but now peppered his racing seasons with a few competitive 50ks. In 2016, he won the Way Too Cool 50k , and the following year, he was back representing Team USA over the 50k distance at the 2017 Trail World Championships in Italy. As his perspective on the kind of athlete he could be slowly shifted, Roche began to push the distances out further in 2023, winning the McDowell Mountain Frenzy 50 Mile and placing fifth at the Canyons 100k , where gastrointestinal issues made him realize he needed to focus even more on solving the fueling puzzle. But one major ultrarunning right-of-passage remained \u2014 100 miles. He shared, \u201cI always wanted to [try 100 miles] because coaching lets you see just how fulfilling that process can be. Then, I started to realize in my training that I had solved a bit of my personal puzzle. I understood that maybe I hadn\u2019t put the results on paper yet to back it up; I was ready to take some big swings at something totally different.\u201d Roche on a training run with Addie Dog. Photo courtesy of David Roche. The 2024 Leadville 100 Mile And so, the seed was sown for the 2024 Leadville 100 Mile, and from early on, Roche set his sights on Matt Carpenter\u2019s course record, which had stood since 2005. To secure an entry to the 100 miler, Roche first signed up for the 2024 Silver Rush 50 Mile in Leadville, Colorado, which he won, and his sights were now fully set on the long distance. Roche, who still breaks down training and racing to solving a series of problems, said: \u201cThis 100 miler at altitude presents such interesting scientific conundrums. A lot of the race is fast and smooth running, but then some of the race \u2014 25 miles of it \u2014 is one of the nastier mountain races in the country. It goes up and over Hope Pass, which is as hard as it gets. And also, altitude presents a fueling conundrum. It\u2019s tough to do high-carb fueling up there. It\u2019s hard to hydrate in the same way.\u201d After training on the course, Roche prepared a detailed pace chart, which allowed him to accurately predict his finish time to within 30 seconds. He shared: \u201cIf you view it as a bit of a math equation \u2014 for me, I understand how my physiology works at different heart rates very well, so I know I should be able to hold this heart rate for this long. And if I can do that, what it becomes is a fueling competition more than anything. Because when you\u2019re going that hard, you\u2019re burning through so many of your calories, and the only way to make it possible is by taking in a ton of fuel.\u201d Roche put away 120 to 140 grams of carbohydrates per hour for the duration of the race, which he credits with allowing him to maintain an intense effort for longer than he had ever run before.

Photo: Cody Bare By managing his effort and fueling according to the plan, the day went as smoothly as a 100-mile race can, with Roche getting 80 miles in before hitting any major low points. He recalled, \u201cThere is a climb at mile 80 called Powerline. It\u2019s a very steep climb, and it goes back up to altitude. I was starting to pass out at the top of that climb \u2026 My pacer Teddy said, \u2018Just get down in altitude.\u2019 Then everything was pretty fine.\u201d Roche cruised to the finish in 15 hours, 26 minutes, and 34 seconds \u2014 to rapturous applause \u2014 taking 16 minutes off a seemingly untouchable course record. But more than the result, he recalls: \u201cI really got to have fun during it; that\u2019s the part I look back on so fondly, and getting to see Megan at aid stations. And the cool thing about this course is it\u2019s an out-and-back, so I got to see every single athlete doing the race.\u201d Checking in with son, Leo, at a checkpoint. Photo: Cody Bare The 2024 Javelina 100 Mile Despite the huge stir that Roche\u2019s achievement prompted in the ultrarunning world, internally, he struggled with imposter syndrome. He needed to prove to himself that it was not a \u201cfluke,\u201d and he was searching for another goal before long. And that\u2019s when the 2024 Javelina 100 Mile presented itself as an attractive option. He shared his reasoning: \u201cJavelina is a Golden Ticket race to the Western States 100 . And I love Aravaipa Running, and Jamil Coury and Jubilee Page , the race director. They are some of the best people in the community. So, I thought, What better place to challenge myself .\u201d In Javelina, Roche saw a completely different kind of problem to solve to Leadville \u2014 a field with greater competitive depth and a flat, fast, hot race without the altitude component. He proved his versatility and took a commanding win in 12 hours and 45 minutes, earning a Golden Ticket to the 2025 Western States 100.

Always one to wear his ambitions on his sleeve, Roche shared, \u201cJust like at Leadville, I was not shy about saying, \u2018I want to take the course record.\u2019 At Western States, I\u2019m not shy about saying I want to win.\u201d However, he is not underestimating the competition and added: \u201cThe thing about Western States is the best athletes that ever lived will be running it. Realistically, I might have less than a 1% chance. But I think sports are all about taking big shots.\u201d Roche credits the support of his wife Megan with his success. He said, \u201cMegan is the smartest, kindest, warmest person I\u2019ve ever met. And so, living with her and having her as a coach and daily support makes everything feel possible.\u201d The two share parenting duties but also prioritize one another\u2019s training, and he said: \u201cWe tell the other person that, \u2018Whatever you need for training, you get. And we\u2019re never going to make you feel guilty about it.\u2019\u201d The Roche family enjoying a day at the beach. Photo courtesy of David Roche. Roche is very open about sharing his training publicly, in the hope that others can learn something from his methods and contribute in some way to the growing body of knowledge on endurance training. He said, \u201cI want to see not just what I can do; I want to see what humans can do.\u201d In the build-up to the race, he is publishing a series on his YouTube channel called \u201c Road to Western States 100 .\u201d Once June 2025 rolls around, we will be very interested to see what this particular human can do on his Western States 100 debut.

Team USA plays its northern neighbor for the 4 Nations championship tonight, reflecting the fast-closing gap between the upstart Americans and long-dominant Canadians. Nathan MacKinnon of Team Canada and Dylan Larkin of Team United States face off in a 4 Nations game in Montreal on Saturday. Vitor Munhoz / Getty Images By David K. Li Whether it\u2019s on the ice or in the trophy cabinet, American hockey players have been rapidly melting Canada\u2019s longtime dominance in the sport. When Team USA and Canada meet on the TD Garden rink in Boston on Thursday night in the championship game of the inaugural 4 Nations Face- O ff (8 p.m. ET on ESPN), it\u2019ll be one more instance of the neighbors appearing to be near-equals in the s port invented north of the border . \u201cThere\u2019s two really good teams that are going to compete extremely hard and do everything they can to win,\u201d U.S. coach Mike Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cHow good is that for hockey? It\u2019s an unbelievable celebration of hockey. Both teams will be emotionally invested.\u201d The NHL, the world\u2019s most elite and lucrative hockey league, has long been dominated by Canadian players. But in just the past few years, the gap between Canadian- and U.S.-born players has dramatically reduced. As recently as the 2021-22 season, there were 481 Canadian-born players who took the NHL ice \u2014 438 forwards and defenseman and 43 goaltenders . That was 161 more than the total number of American-born players that season \u2014 320, with 294 skaters and 26 between the pipes . The gap has decreased every season since and is now down to 107 a little more than halfway through this 2024-25 NHL campaign. So far this NHL season, there have been 359 skaters and 27 net minders born in Canada compared to their 260 and 19 American counterparts . Thursday\u2019s matchup will pit the best against the best. \u201cIt\u2019s the USA vs. Canada, so it\u2019s what you come to expect,\u201d American defenseman Jac c ob Slavin said. \u201cI think for all of us, it\u2019s probably one of the coolest games we\u2019ve ever played in. So I can only imagine it\u2019s going to be that intensity again.\u201d Earlier in the tournament, the Americans beat Canada in Montreal in a game marked by three fights breaking out in the first nine seconds of play. American forward Jack Hughes anticipates the environment to be \u201ccrazy\u201d once again. \u201cProbably the same same energy, same physicality, same speed, probably just a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know they\u2019re excited to get us again, and we\u2019re looking forward to playing them again.\u201d Tonight\u2019s 4 Nations Face-Off final could very well be a preview of games in Milan a year from now when NHL players make their first appearance on Olympic ice since 2014. The world\u2019s top hockey players were first allowed to be in the Olympics in 1998, but the NHL , its players union, the world body governing international hockey and the International Olympic Committee couldn\u2019t come to terms for the pros to play in 2018 and 2022. Though the hockey world hasn\u2019t yet seen the United States\u2019 recent surge on Olympic ice, it has been found in results of the IIHF World Junior Championship, an annual post-Christmas tournament featuring the world\u2019s best teenage players. Team USA has won the past two gold medals and taken the top spot four times in the past nine competitions. \u201cOur team\u2019s helped grow the game here in this country already,\u201d said American forward Matthew Tkachuk, the son of 538-goal scorer Keith Tkachuk and brother of teammate Brady Tkachuk . \u201cAnd I think a win can just knock that door right down and open up a whole new wave of hockey players throughout the whole country.\u201d While the U.S. National Team Development Program has been clearly excelling at identifying and coaching elite talent, that work hasn\u2019t necessarily resulted in mass growth at the most grassroots level. There were 1,641 high schools offering boys ice hockey in 2023-24, with 32,996 players suiting up, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. Those levels have been relatively unchanged for the past decade and a half . Glenn Hefferan , president and commissioner of the junior-level United States Hockey League, said the hockey infrastructure isn\u2019t there yet. He dreams of a \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d hockey culture that can someday be the game\u2019s bedrock, similar to how high school gridiron action underpins all of football. \u201cIt boils down to access,\u201d Hefferan told NBC News from Boston on Wednesday. \u201cEvery single youth athlete experiences their moment in a sport for the first time in their hometown, whether it\u2019s soccer, baseball, football, basketball and lacrosse. That\u2019s not the case for hockey unless you live in places like Minnesota. So we need Kentucky to have more rinks, Tennessee to have more rinks, Florida to have more rinks.\u201d And of course, the U.S. still needs to break through at the highest level of play. Since the \u201c Miracle on Ice \u201d team of 1980 , the U.S. has yet to capture Olympic gold again \u2014 though America came agonizingly close with silver medal efforts in 2002 and 2010 . Team USA won the 1996 World Cup of Hockey . U.S. coach Sullivan, 56, said his love of hockey can be traced to that 1980 \u201c Miracle \u201d team and hopes his squad can have that same impact on the future of American players. \u201cThat event in USA Hockey inspired a generation of players \u2014 my generation,\u201d Sullivan said of that Lake Placid team . \u201cI think this group that we have in our dressing room have an opportunity to do that and inspire the next generation. And I think they recognize that.\u201d David K. Li Senior Breaking News Reporter The Associated Press contributed .

watch Leicester vs Brentford live on Sky Sports Premier League from 7.30pm on Friday; kick-off 8pm Nick Wright Comment and Analysis @nicholaspwright Friday 21 February 2025 14:07, UK Leicester face Brentford on Friday aiming for only a third win in 12 Premier League games under Ruud van Nistelrooy. No player is more important to their hopes of getting it than Bilal El Khannouss. The 20-year-old midfielder, a \u00a321m signing from Genk in August, has been one of few positives in a poor season for the club, starting every game since Van Nistelrooy succeeded Steve Cooper in November and showing star quality in adversity. The threat of relegation looms but his own future at the top looks secure. He was vital to Leicester's two Premier League wins under the new boss. El Khannouss set up Jamie Vardy's opener and scored the second himself in the 3-1 victory over West Ham in his first game in charge. He struck the winner in last month's 2-1 triumph at Spurs . Both of his goals in those games, along with his sublime, outside-of-the-boot strike in Leicester's Carabao Cup loss to Manchester United in October, were passed into the net in a style familiar to his coaches at Genk, where his guile shone through from a young age.

Not shooting with power, but always going to the corners,\" Miguel Ribeiro, Genk's first-team technical and individual coach, tells Sky Sports . That precision shines through in his game now. El Khannouss is a joy to watch and a joy to work with too, according to Ribeiro, who says his positive impact in the Premier League, after racking up nearly 100 senior appearances for Genk, has come as no surprise. \"I always thought he would adapt very fast when he got the chance because he did it at Genk. From the first moment he trained with the first-team, it was clear. Maybe he had to make some steps physically, because he was 17 or 18, but football-wise it was easy for him.\" Also See: Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW Watch FREE PL highlights on the app Premier League fixtures The Belgian club have a reputation for nurturing young talent having developed Kevin De Bruyne, Leandro Trossard and many others. They have similarly high hopes for El Khannouss. \"We took him when he was 14 from Anderlecht, where they didn't believe in him as much as we did,\" says Ribeiro. \"He was a tiny, slight boy at that age, very thin. But he had unbelievable feet and great vision, and he was always hungry to learn and do extra stuff. \"The way you are seeing him play for Leicester is the way he trained here with us. Always happy, with a big smile, working hard. Of course, he needs the confidence of his coach, but I think he has got that with Van Nistelrooy, becoming a starter. You can see he has grown.\" Image: Bilal El Khannouss celebrates after scoring Leicester's winner against Tottenham Having only started four games of a possible 15 under Cooper, El Khannouss has been one of two ever-presents under Van Nistelrooy along with James Justin. Leicester's results have been poor. But it is not just in their rare victories that El Khannouss has shone. Arsenal kept him quiet last time out but he looked right at home against top opposition in the 2-0 loss to Manchester City in December, during which he made twice as many dribbles as any other player and ranked top for duels won and final-third passes. He was excellent again in the recent FA Cup loss to Manchester United. Those were standout performances from the Morocco international, who has 18 caps for his country, but his fast footwork and technical class have delighted supporters consistently. In a position somewhere between a No 10 and a left-sided No 8, El Khannouss glides across the turf, honing in on gaps in defences and trying to make things happen. He is Leicester's spark. Supporters showed how highly they rate him when they booed the decision to take him off early in last month's loss to Fulham. Image: Bilal El Khannouss \"He never has a problem to play under pressure. He never hides,\" adds Ribeiro. They were important traits as a teenager at Genk; they are even more important now, in the context of a relegation battle at Leicester. \"He is not afraid to take risks and he almost always plays forward,\" continues Ribeiro. \"He finds could spaces between the lines and sees the game very fast.\" Beterbiev vs Bivol 2: Book to watch on TV or online Genk were patient with his physical development - \"we don't push young guys to do too much gym; we let them grow,\" says Ribeiro - and instead sought to maximise his innate ability to read the game. \"I used to tell people that he had eyes in his back, because he sees everything,\" chuckles Ribeiro. \"When you watch him, you see he is always checking around him and looking over his shoulders. \"That was something I talked about with him when he began starting for the first-team at Genk, that he needed to constantly check his back. They call it 'scanning' but, for me, it's just checking your shoulders to see where the spaces are. \"Again, he took the advice really well.\" Leicester City Brentford Friday 21st February 7:30pm Kick off 8:00pm That work later ensured El Khannouss was equipped for the increased speed of the Premier League. There was also a focus on how he received the ball. \"We worked on fast turns, to immediately face the opponent's goal and give himself more options instead of just opening wide on one side,\" says Ribeiro \"If you turn all the way, you can give yourself five or six options for the next pass, using your left or your right foot. Now, you can see that he turns fantastically fast on the ball, even though he is not a short player. People watch him do it now and say, 'Wow', but we have seen it for years.\" Ribeiro describes El Khannouss's future as \"very, very bright\" and Van Nistelrooy sees it the same way. \"I think you're going to see a lot more of him with his age and profile,\" said the Leicester boss earlier this month. \"His potential is there to be a top player in the Champions League. He can go a long way.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Bilal El Khannouss scored the winner in Leicester's 2-1 win over Spurs The next step, in the short term, is to increase his end-product. El Khannouss became key for Genk, twice winning the Belgian league's best young player award. But his numbers were modest, albeit as a teenager, with four goals and 10 assists in 61 league appearances. The same is true at Leicester, where he has two goals and one assist in 20 Premier League games so far. How they would cherish a spike in his productivity now. In fact, their hopes of Premier League survival may depend on it. At only 20 years old, though, and a shining light in a struggling team, El Khannouss already looks destined for big things.
