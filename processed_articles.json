Whether it be by reuniting long friends or connecting new ones, fantasy sports are social games designed to be enjoyed with friends.\nWe got a look at how that sense of community manifests itself on the Blue Jays thanks to Chris Bassitt.\nOn Saturday, Bassitt kept up with the team's tradition on Saturday's Spring Training opener by donning a custom jersey sporting a 4-10 across the back to commemorate his last-place finish in the team's fantasy football league â the same punishment that\nreliever Tim Mayza\nhad to go through last season after also finishing in last place.\nAs the second part of the punishment, Bassitt had to serve as the bayboy during Toronto's game against the Yankees.\nChris Bassitt is serving as the\n#BlueJays\nhonorary bat boy after finishing last on the teamâs fantasy football league.\npic.twitter.com/Nbi8aH2Dic\nâ Hazel Mae (@thehazelmae)\nFebruary 22, 2025\nThe league, which is run by Daulton Varsho, features players from up and down the Blue Jays' roster, all of whom did better than Bassitt.\nFor most people, their fantasy punishment likely revolves around having to eat a certain number of pancakes at Waffle House or having to swear some crazy outfit out in public. But for Bassitt, his punishment meant that he got to do something that nearly every baseball fan would do in a heartbeat.\nChampagne problems, sure, but it doesn't change the fact that the entire world got to take in his last place finish via his customized jersey.\nIf the Blue Jays want to have any success this season, they'll Bassitt to continue to stay in the headlines for his on-the-field success. The 36-year-old is in his third year with the Blue Jays, but is coming off a season where he went 10-14 with a 4.16 ERA in 171 innings, marking the highest ERA of his career.\nHis best season with Toronto came in 2023 when he had a 3.60 ERA in 200 innings while leading the American League with 16 wins.\nBut before Bassitt can build on that, he had to have his day of infamy with a new jersey and new role. And if that wasn't enough, Saturday was also his 36th birthday. What a way to ring in another year around the sun.\nHappy birthday, Chris Bassitt!\n(And better luck in your fantasy football league next season ð)\npic.twitter.com/plNkPJwIe8\nâ MLB (@MLB)\nFebruary 22, 2025\nHome\n/\nToronto Blue Jays News\nSchedule"

Englebert Complex.   | Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nShare on Reddit\nCopy Article\nOne of the great joys of fantasy sports is the amount of community it brings. Whether it be by reuniting long friends or connecting new ones, fantasy sports are social games designed to be enjoyed with friends.\nWe got a look at how that sense of community manifests itself on the Blue Jays thanks to Chris Bassitt.\nOn Saturday, Bassitt kept up with the team's tradition on Saturday's Spring Training opener by donning a custom jersey sporting a 4-10 across the back to commemorate his last-place finish in the team's fantasy football league â the same punishment that\nreliever Tim Mayza\nhad to go through last season after also finishing in last place.\nAs the second part of the punishment, Bassitt had to serve as the bayboy during Toronto's game against the Yankees.\nChris Bassitt is serving as the\n#BlueJays\nhonorary bat boy after finishing last on the teamâs fantasy football league.\npic.twitter.com/Nbi8aH2Dic\nâ Hazel Mae (@thehazelmae)\nFebruary 22, 2025\nThe league, which is run by Daulton Varsho, features players from up and down the Blue Jays' roster, all of whom did better than Bassitt.\nFor most people, their fantasy punishment likely revolves around having to eat a certain number of pancakes at Waffle House or having to swear some crazy outfit out in public. But for Bassitt, his punishment meant that he got to do something that nearly every baseball fan would do in a heartbeat.\nChampagne problems, sure, but it doesn't change the fact that the entire world got to take in his last place finish via his customized jersey.\nIf the Blue Jays want to have any success this season, they'll Bassitt to continue to stay in the headlines for his on-the-field success. The 36-year-old is in his third year with the Blue Jays, but is coming off a season where he went 10-14 with a 4.16 ERA in 171 innings, marking the highest ERA of his career.\nHis best season with Toronto came in 2023 when he had a 3.60 ERA in 200 innings while leading the American League with 16 wins.\nBut before Bassitt can build on that, he had to have his day of infamy with a new jersey and new role. And if that wasn't enough, Saturday was also his 36th birthday. What a way to ring in another year around the sun.\nHappy birthday, Chris Bassitt!\n(And better luck in your fantasy football league next season ð)\npic.twitter.com/plNkPJwIe8\nâ MLB (@MLB)\nFebruary 22, 2025\nHome\n/\nToronto Blue Jays News\nSchedule"

                "'He put himself second and always put others first': Ariton, Troy react to death of Coach Polk - The Troy Messenger | The Troy Messenger\nSubscribe\n‘He put himself second and always put others first’: Ariton, Troy react to death of Coach Polk\nPublished 9:56 am Saturday, February 22, 2025\nBy\nStaff Reports\nTaylor Polk, pictured here with his wife Katie and son Judge, was a coach and teacher at Ariton and Charles Henderson High School, as well as a former member of the Troy University Trojans football team.\nThe Pike County and Ariton communities are mourning the death of Taylor Polk, a young coach who “was so loved by so many.”\nPolk, a Demopolis native who was a long-snapper for Troy University, was an assistant football and baseball coach at Ariton as well as the b-team basketball coach. He taught special education for Ariton for seven years. He also was the assistant baseball coach and football coach at Charles Henderson from 2017-2018 before serving as interim head baseball coach.\n“(When) I hired coach Polk, one thing that stood out to me about him was his willingness to do anything for anyone no matter what it was, whether in his professional career in special education or in his coaching career,” said Josh Herring, Ariton principal. “I hired him and needed a b-team basketball coach and he said, ‘I don’t know a lot about basketball but I’ll learn it.’ That’s what he did, he got under some of the best like Coach Brett and Terry Goodson and learned from them and worked hard. He was always dependable, always on time and always there.”\nHerring said Polk’s love for his students and athletes was evident. “He had that unique ability to put himself second and always put others first. In this life we have so many adults that struggle with putting others first and he had no struggle with that. He was willing to do anything for everybody and his abilities as a person bled over into his profession as a teacher and a coach. His willingness to be a servant and to help made him good at everything he did.”\nAnd it is also the reason he had such an impact on the lives of his students, co-workers and friends. “The impact he’s had on the diverse population of athletes to students to the kids he served – I’m at a loss for words to even describe that impact. I couldn’t say enough about him,” Herring said. “He never wanted to let someone down, he wanted to please you. Whatever the circumstances were he would always rise to the challenge. That alone made him so dependable and valuable to Ariton.”\nFormer Ariton football star Ian Senn, now playing for Troy, talked about what Polk meant to he and his teammates.\n“Coach Polk wasn’t just a coach to me, he was one of my best friends and I think I could say that for most of my teammates,” Senn said.  “There wasn’t a kid that Coach Polk came in touch with that didn’t feel loved. Practice was never boring with him there and serious moments weren’t serious for long. There aren’t enough words to describe the impact he made on my life and the people at Ariton. He will be forever be loved and missed.”\nAriton head football coach Steven Kilcrease also talked of Polk’s impact.\n“We are heartbroken. He was such a hard working coach,” Kilcrease said. “Last year’s team doesn’t advance to the quarterfinals if not for Taylor Polk. We knew shortly after he was hired that he had that IT factor. He was just a genuine, caring person. More importantly he had a huge love for these kids and they knew it!\nTributes to Polk’s impact in both communities were offered throughout social media on Saturday morning.\n“Coach Polk was so loved by so many! Please pray hard for his family, students, friends, coworkers, and all of those who he made an impact on,” wrote Eden Lunn\n“Our hearts are shattered,” wrote Cassidy Smartt with her husband and CHHS head baseball coach Chase Smartt. “Polk was such an amazing guy and we are so thankful for the time we have shared with him.”\n“Taylor made a difference in the lives of many kids including three of mine when he was at CHHS,” wrote Elly Reeves. “He truly cared about them and they felt it. He will be remembered by our family forever.”\n“Taylor was so very loved and admired. Even though he was such a young teacher when he was at Charles Henderson, he was a role model for other teachers,” wrote Lynn Melton. “He truly was one of the best.”\n“Taylor Polk was not only a wonderful teacher for our son, he was a great role model to learn from,” wrote Connie McCrary.\nPolk is survived by his wife, Katie, and son Judge.\n“Through this unimaginable experience I have seen what God does in a community,” Katie Polk wrote on Facebook. “To anyone and everyone who has reached out to me or our family and to those who flooded us in prayers, thank you from the very bottom of my heart. To our Purple Cat family, Taylor loved his job and his students and everyone he worked with making you all irreplaceable to me for making him so happy. I rejoice in the fact that I will see Taylor every single day in the face and actions of our little boy, and I find peace and comfort knowing his body is completely restored. This is not the end for us, because I know I will see Taylor again and we will have a true eternity together. In the coming days, your prayers are more than appreciated for us.”\nMore Uncategorized\nGustav Nyquist Player Prop Bets for the Predators vs. Canucks Game – January 29\nRoman Josi Player Prop Bets for the Predators vs. Canucks Game – January 29\nJonathan Marchessault Player Prop Bets for the Predators vs. Canucks Game – January 29\nSteven Stamkos Player Prop Bets for the Predators vs. Canucks Game – January 29\nPrint Article\nSports\nPlus\nHow to Watch SWAC College Basketball Games – Monday, February 3\nThere are four games featuring a SWAC team on the Monday college basketball schedule, including the Jackson State…\nHow to Watch Alabama State vs. Florida A&M on TV or Live Stream – February 3\nThe Florida A&M Rattlers (8-11, 5-3 SWAC) will attempt to build on a three-game home winning streak when…\nBuy Tickets for Nashville Predators vs. Ottawa Senators on February 3\nThe Nashville Predators’ Roman Josi and the Ottawa Senators’ Brady Tkachuk will be two of the most exciting…\nBrady Skjei Player Prop Bets for the Predators vs. Senators Game – February 3\nThe Nashville Predators, including Brady Skjei, play the Ottawa Senators on Monday, February 3, 2025 at 7:30 PM…\nSteven Stamkos Player Prop Bets for the Predators vs. Senators Game – February 3\nThe Nashville Predators, including Steven Stamkos, will be in action Monday versus the Ottawa Senators at Bridgestone Arena,…\nHow to Watch\nInjury Report\nPlayer Props\nTickets\nSections\nHome\nNews\nSports\nOpinion\nLifestyles\nObituaries\nBusiness\nSmall Business\nServices\nAbout Us\nSubscriptions\nPolicies\nSubmit a News Tip\nSubmit a Photo\nSubmit a Letter to the Editor\nBirth Announcement\nBirthday Announcement\nEngagement Announcement\nWedding Announcement\nCopyright\n© 2025, The Troy Messenger"

                "Memories, how they linger - The Troy Messenger | The Troy Messenger\nSubscribe\nMemories, how they linger\nPublished 5:23 pm Friday, February 21, 2025\nBy\nJaine Treadwell\nHandmade dolls are not as commonplace as they once were. Although tattered and a bit torn, they hold memories of childhood and of friends and other people in their lives.\nDonald Davis, the Dean of Storytelling, and also, an author, will be at the We Piddle Around Theater in Brundidge Friday night. March 1 only. He recently published a book titled “How They Linger: Stories of Unforgettable Souls.”\nReading Donald Davis’ book, I began thinking about the “unforgettable souls” in my life and how they made my life better for having been a part of it. I recently shared the story titled, “Don’t Nobody Appreciate Agnes,” and was surprised by the number of people who shared their stories of Agnes with others.\nThis week, thinking about Donald Davis at the We Piddle Around Friday night; Black History Week at Pike County High School and the upcoming quilt show on Saturday at the Pioneer Museum of Alabama, an unforgettable soul touched my heart. This is her story.\nHazel was a regular at the Colley Senior Complex. She made dolls from scrap material and gave them away to those who had the capacity to enjoy them.\nIn 2005, Appalachian storyteller Sheila Kay Adams was to be a feature teller at the We Piddle Around Theater. She would be the first storyteller to take the stage at the small-town theater. Being Southerners, we wanted to give her a meaningful gift, but what?\nSheila often told stories about her much-loved granny. So, we asked to Hazel to make a granny doll for her gift. The doll had grey hair in a bun, glasses, a flour-sack dress and the sweetest face. We all wanted to take her home. But knowing we could not. She was a gift for the storyteller coming to our downtown theater.\nHazel and I often shared stories of growing up the rural South and about the people we knew and loved and how they influenced our lives.\nOne afternoon, Hazel surprise me with two flour sack dolls, one white and one black. Hazel had heard me often talk about me and my friend Louise. She realized how much we cared for each other.\nHazel had not drawn faces on our dolls’ faces; she sewed on their eyes and lips and made flour sack dresses for them.\nThey were beautiful.\nMany years had passed and I had almost forgotten about Hazel’s dolls. No one knew happened to Hazel’s dolls.\nThe upstairs of my grandmother’s house had plenty storage space for things we had but didn’t want. Maybe, just maybe, somebody had cared enough to keep our Hazel-made dolls.\nI could not believe what I was seeing.

                "By\nMike Cason | mcason@al.com\nFILE - Alabama Secretary of State, Wes Allen speaks during the inauguration ceremony on the steps of the Alabama State Capital, Jan. 16, 2023, in Montgomery, Ala. (AP Photo/Butch Dill, File)\nAP\nAlabama Secretary of State Wes Allen said today he would run for lieutenant governor next year.\n“For a kid that grew up at the end of a dirt road to have the opportunity to serve in public life like what I’ve been able to do so far, as probate judge and in the State House and now as secretary of state, it’s just very, very humbling to be in the position that God has placed me in.\n“And then to be able to go and seek the lieutenant governor’s office and to be in this position to ask the fine people of Alabama to put their trust in me again in this position is just very, very humbling.”\nThe race is for an open seat.\nLt. Gov. Will Ainsworth is term-limited and\nis considering a run for governor.\n“I believe it’s time for me to take my record of conservative leadership to that office,” Allen said.\nAllen, who grew up in Cottondale in Tuscaloosa County, becomes the second Republican to announce he is running for the seat, following\nOpelika pastor Dean Odle.\nThe primary is in May 2026.\nAllen is the son of state Sen. Gerald Allen, R-Cottondale.\nHe was elected secretary of state, the state’s top election official, in 2022. Before that he was probate judge in Pike County for nine years and then represented Pike County and part of Dale County in the state House of Representatives for four years.\nAllen said he was proud of the work accomplished since taking office as secretary of state in January 2023, including what he said was an effort to clean up and maintain the voter rolls.\nLast year,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice sued Allen,\nsaying he violated federal law when he took steps to have 3,251 voters placed on inactive status because he said they had received non-citizen identification numbers. It turned out that many on the list were citizens,\nsome of whom filed a separate lawsuit.\nThe DOJ said the voter purge violated a law saying that broad efforts to remove ineligible voters from the rolls had to be completed more than 90 days before an election.\nAllen said today he could not say much about what happened because the case is ongoing.\n“I’m proud of the team that we have in place that’s done the hard work that it took to create a program that has resulted in I think a much more accurate voter file, and the people of Alabama deserve that,” Allen said.\nTen years ago, as Pike County’s probate judge,\nAllen stopped issuing marriage licenses\nafter the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated state laws against gay marriage.\nAllen said issuing licenses to same-sex couples would have gone against his Christian beliefs and said state law did not require his office to issue licenses.\n“The people of Pike County elected me because of the person and beliefs that I had and deeply held beliefs,” Allen said. “And I don’t have any regrets at all with that decision to stand up and defend marriage between one man and one woman.”\nAs a state lawmaker, Allen sponsored for three years\na bill making it a felony for a doctor to perform surgeries or provide puberty blockers or hormones\nas transitional therapies for transgender minors.\nThe bill, called the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, passed in 2022. It was\ninitially blocked by a federal judge\nbut later\nupheld by an appeals court.\nAlabama was one of the first states to pass a law banning the transitional treatments for minors.\nMore than half the states now have similar laws. In December, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging Tennessee’s ban. The justices are expected to rule later this year.\nAllen said the Tennessee law is very similar to Alabama’s.\n“It was 2020 when we introduced that,” Allen said. “We were the second state to pass it, right behind Arkansas. So very proud of that piece of legislation.\n“I think what we’ve been able to see for five years now is the vindication of what we knew at the time. We wanted to protect children.”\nAllen said he uses an experience from when he was probate judge to remind himself of the job of an elected official. He said a young man who drove heavy equipment and had his own business stopped by his office.\n“When he left, I came back in the office and there was mud on the carpet from where he was sitting in front of my desk,” Allen said. “And I got it cleaned up. But I got to reflecting a lot about what that mud represented. And it represented that man’s life. And it represented all those times that he got up early before daylight to go to work to provide for his family, to provide for those employees. To pay the taxes there in Pike County and the state and invest in his community.\n“That’s something that’s never left me and was seared into my brain about the mud represents that man’s life. It represents the taxpayers that we represent. It represents all those taxpayers throughout the state of Alabama that get up every day and work hard. And that I work for the taxpayers and not the other way around.”\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy."

                "Marijuana arrests are latest spotlight on vape stores - Smithfield Times | Smithfield Times\nSubscribe\nMarijuana arrests are latest spotlight on vape stores\nPublished 6:00 pm Friday, February 21, 2025\nBy\nStephen Faleski\nA zoning violation sign is taped to the window of Planet Tobacco & Mart warning the store is closed indefinitely.\nThe indefinite closure of four Smithfield smoke shops for alleged zoning violations tied to a police raid is the latest effort by the town to keep a closer eye on vape stores.\nTown officials affixed pink “zoning violation, no sales permitted” signs to the doors of the stores after Smithfield Police said a Feb. 10 search had found nearly $40,000 worth of marijuana being sold out of the establishments.\nPlanet Tobacco & Mart, the newest of the four smoke shops, opened in 2023 at the former 7-Eleven on South Church Street. It was unpopular from the start with Smithfield’s Planning Commission, whose members conceded they couldn’t legally stop prohibit the business because the town’s zoning ordinance at that time didn’t differentiate between smoke shops and other forms of retail permitted by right in commercial zoning.\nSubscribe to our free email newsletter\nGet the latest news sent to your inbox\nThe Town Council voted to close the loophole later that year by amending the zoning ordinance to require special use permits for any future “recreational substance establishments,” which are now defined as stores devoting 25% or more of their total inventory, or 15% or more of their total shelf space, to tobacco, any noncombustible product containing nicotine or vaping fluid, hemp and raw materials made from hemp, Kratom or cannabidiol, also known as CBD.\nThe change didn’t initially apply to Planet Tobacco or the other three existing smoke shops in town, which at that point were grandfathered under the prior language.\nThe town does, however, have the authority to revoke an existing establishment’s business license for zoning ordinance violations, according to Community Development and Planning Director Tammie Clary, who said the sale of marijuana is not a permitted use in any zoning. The state’s 2020 decriminalization of possessing up to an ounce of marijuana presently only allows the growing of up to four marijuana plants in homes for personal use.\nClary said if any of the four closed stores wished to reopen, they would no longer be grandfathered and would have to apply for a special use permit as a recreational substance establishment.\nPolice say the multi-agency four-month undercover investigation began with a tip alleging the four stores were selling their wares to underage customers in violation of a state law that sets 21 as the minimum age to buy vape pens, a type of electronic cigarette that heats a liquid to deliver nicotine or other drugs and chemicals in aerosolized form. However, the only charges to date against four store employees arrested during the sting pertain to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Retail marijuana remains illegal in Virginia though legislation is pending that would legalize its retail sale by 2026.\nOfficials with Isle of Wight County Schools have also drawn attention in recent years to the proliferation of vape stores and the related issue of vaping supplies falling into the hands of students.\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s 2024 annual national youth tobacco survey, 1.2 million, or 7.8%, of high school students nationwide reported using e-cigarettes. More than one in four self-identified teen users said they used vape products daily.\n“All stores are required to follow the same state codes and ask for state identification to verify the purchasers’ age before selling the product,” said Deputy 1st Class Alecia Paul, a spokeswoman for the Isle of Wight County Sheriff’s Office.\nSmithfield High School Principal Patricia Cuffee, during budget discussions last February, told the School Board more than half of all student suspensions as of that point in the 2023-24 school year had been tied to vape pens. For every vape offense, a student receives five days out-of-school suspension, and 10 days if the vape is found to be laced with THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana.\nJason Brinkley, the school division’s security and emergency management specialist, said at last year’s budget meeting that THC offenses, in addition to triggering a student’s suspension, are also brought to the sheriff’s deputy serving as the school resource officer for referral to the criminal justice system.\n“Almost all cases are sent to diversion,” Paul said, where charges are dropped after a period of probation.\n“Our deputies compliment and try to parallel the school policies on vaping,” Paul said. “Typically we don’t charge until a third or subsequent offense. Charging is at the deputy’s discretion based on their knowledge and past incidents.”\nIn 2023 and 2024, the School Board debated buying vape detection systems, but those devices ultimately weren’t purchased, according to IWCS spokeswoman Lynn Briggs. Vape detection systems, according to the websites of multiple manufacturers, detect the chemicals emitted by vaping devices.\n“Upon further investigation, we discovered a trend on social media platforms on how to defeat the vape detectors in schools,” Briggs said. “Because of this, the vape detectors have not been pursued any further.”\nVaping devices have, however, been confiscated as a result of the new weapon detection systems Isle of Wight County Schools is in the process of installing at its two high schools, Briggs said.\n“It’s safe to say that vapes continue to be a problem in our schools,” she said.\nFeatured Local Savings\nMore News\nSurry schools seek $750K increase from county\nBill to repeal ‘skill game’ ban dies\nIW-backed Senate bill to lessen local cost of veterans’ tax breaks stalls\nNWS offers preliminary snowfall analysis for Western Tidewater\nPrint Article\nSports\nPlus\nHow to Watch Old Dominion vs. Georgia Southern Women’s Basketball on TV or Live Stream – February 22\nSaturday’s Sun Belt schedule will see the Old Dominion Monarchs (15-13) square off against the Georgia Southern Eagles…\nHow to Watch Coppin State vs. Norfolk State Women’s Basketball on TV or Live Stream – February 22\nThe Coppin State Eagles (16-9) carry a five-game win streak into a home contest with the Norfolk State…\nNorfolk State vs. Coppin State Predictions & Picks: Spread, Total – February 22\nSaturday’s game between the Norfolk State Spartans (18-8, 8-1 MEAC) and Coppin State Eagles (4-20, 2-7 MEAC) at…\nCollege Basketball Picks Against the Spread: MEAC Games Today, February 22\nThe South Carolina State Bulldogs versus the Delaware State Hornets is one of many solid options on Saturday…\nElon vs. William & Mary Predictions & Picks: Spread, Total – February 22\nSaturday’s game features the Elon Phoenix (17-11, 8-7 CAA) and the William & Mary Tribe (16-11, 10-4 CAA)…\nHow to Watch\nInjury Report\nPlayer Props\nPower Rankings\nTickets\nSpecial Sections\nSections\nHome\nNews\nSports\nOpinion\nSmall Business\nServices\nAbout Us\nCopyright\n© 2025, Smithfield Times"
