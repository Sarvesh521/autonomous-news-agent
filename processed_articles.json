Until he got physically close to her, started having contact in the form of selfies, hugging, etc.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nChelsea defender Lucy Bronze reflects on safety for women in sport after Emma Raducanu was targeted by a man who 'exhibited fixated behaviour' at the Dubai Tennis Championships\nSky Sports understands Raducanu was approached by the same man outside of the tournament perimeter - and not in the tournament hotel - on Monday afternoon.\n\"That was the only moment in a month where I, the fitness coach, the security guard who was with us, was not with her at that moment,\" Kelecic added.\n\"So that man was assessing the situation and looking for the best moment to get closer to her. He had a strategy that was terrifying, he thought everything through, calculated it.\n\"It's terrifying how much he, in essence, thought about it all and planned it. His strategy worked and it was to get closer to her. That evening we reported it immediately and again in the morning, when she was playing the match, because her safety is the most important thing to us.\"\nThe WTA and Tournament security teams are understood to have been notified Tuesday at noon, with 'extra efforts' made prior to her match to identify the individual, although it was actually Raducanu who saw him in the crowd and asked for him to be removed.\n\"Three or four hours before the match we have a photo of that stalker.\" Kelecic explained. \"Not only us, the entire security at the tournament has his photo and everyone knows who he is.\n\"The first game, two points gone, 15-15, Emma is on the other side of the court and she's showing us something. At that moment we didn't know what it was. Emma loses the first game and runs to us, crying, shouting, 'here he is, here he is, here he is'.\"\nDubai Police have since confirmed: \"While Raducanu later chose to drop the charges, the individual signed a formal undertaking to maintain distance from her and has been banned from future tournaments.\"\nRaducanu approached the umpire's chair in tears just two games into her second-round defeat to Karolina Muchova on Tuesday before the individual in question was subsequently ejected from the court by security and banned from all future WTA events \"pending a threat assessment\".\nThe former US Open champion took to Instagram on Wednesday to thank fans and Muchova for their support following the incident.\n\"Difficult experience yesterday but I'll be OK and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match,\" she posted. \"Thank you to Karolina for being a great sport and best of luck to her for the rest of the tournament.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nHighlights of the Dubai Tennis Championships match between Emma Raducanu and Karolina Muchova\nWhat support was Raducanu given?\nPlayers are usually escorted to and from the court by at least one security officer, while the WTA provides enhanced security to a player if she has been the target of a credible threat.\nThe Women's Tennis Association (WTA) told\nSky Sports\nthat extra security was provided to Emma when they learned of the situation involving the individual who approached her. Dedicated security escorted her to and from the court and remained at the court when her match was taking place Tuesday night.\nThe WTA released a statement insisting player safety is their \"top priority\" and that they would be working with Raducanu and her team to ensure she receives all the support she may require.\nTwitter\nThis content is provided by\nTwitter\n, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\nTo show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\nYou can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable\nTwitter\ncookies or to allow those cookies just once.\nYou can change your settings at any time via the\nPrivacy Options\n.\nUnfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to\nTwitter\ncookies.\nTo view this content you can use the button below to allow\nTwitter\ncookies for this session only.\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\nA spokesperson for the Lawn Tennis Association also told\nSky Sports News\n. \"This incident once again highlights issues around safety that all players, but female players in particular, can face.\n\"We have support available for British players and have been in contact with Emma and her team following the events in Dubai. We have extensive security arrangements at our events in Britain and keep these under constant review.\n\"The tours have strong processes in place already and we will continue to work together, along with police and security providers, to deal with situations like this robustly.\"\nThe incident came three years on from a man being handed a five-year restraining order after walking 23 miles to Raducanu's London home.\nSmith 'horrified' at Raducanu incident\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nFormer British No 1 Sam Smith expects both the WTA and ATP tours to step up security after Emma Raducanu was targeted by a man who 'exhibited fixated behaviour' during her match at the Dubai Tennis Championships\nFormer British No 1 Sam Smith on Sky Sports News:\n\"I was horrified. Credit to Emma. You would never know what she had been through with the way she was playing and competing. I don't know how she did that.\n\"Emma had the presence of mind to stop, talk to the umpire. It looked as if the tournament reacted very quickly, so did the WTA and the person was removed very quickly.\n\"They did everything they could possibly do to make sure Emma was as protected as possible, certainly in a physical sense, but psychologically it was difficult for her to continue and play the match.\n\"I've never experienced it myself but even for a minor incident in the crowd, for example if someone is unwell or there's a disturbance, it can be hard.\n\"Tennis players are trained to switch on and off but I don't think anyone is built psychologically to cope with what Emma had to cope with in Dubai, and having to get over that in future matches.\n\"The WTA and ATP Tours will double down on looking at their protocols, which worked pretty well, but they absolutely prioritise player safety and wellbeing. They will look at whether they can take it to another level and I think they might have to.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, help is available online at\nsky.com/viewersupport\n.\nAround Sky\nOther Sports\nUpgrade to Sky Sports\nOther Sports\nNot got Sky?

                "Sinner 'has timed it all as sweetly as one of his whiplash forehand'\n(Image credit: Andy Cheung / Contributor / Getty Images)\nBy\nThe Week UK\npublished\n22 February 2025\nNick Kyrgios called it a \"sad day for tennis\"; Tim Henman said it \"leaves a pretty sour taste\". Last Saturday, it was announced that the world's best player, Jannik Sinner, had negotiated a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over offences committed last March, and would be banned for just three months.\nSinner twice tested positive for the\nbanned steroid\nclostebol, said Stuart Fraser in\nThe Times\n. He claimed the substance had entered his system accidentally, as a result of it being present in an over-the-counter spray used by his physiotherapist to treat a small wound. And last August, a tribunal cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing. But that decision was appealed by\nWada\n, on the grounds that even if the Italian wasn't personally at fault, he was still responsible for mistakes by his team. At a hearing scheduled for April, Wada said it would seek a one-year ban. But a compromise agreement has been reached which bans Sinner until 4 May – allowing him to return for the French Open.\nThis outcome fits Sinner's interests so precisely as to almost seem like no punishment at all, said Simon Briggs in\nThe Daily Telegraph\n. Had his ban started after Wada's appeal was due to be heard, he would have missed both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. As it is, he will be able to put his feet up during the \"dog days of late winter and early spring\", before returning for the crucial summer tournaments.\nSubscribe to\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Sinner's case, and that of women's No. 2\nIga Swiatek\n(who last year received a month-long ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance), contrast starkly with that of some lower-ranked players. Take Britain's Tara Moore, who in 2022 was banned after testing positive for nandrolone metabolites and Boldenone. After 19 months of tortuous wrangling, \"the source was found to be contaminated meat at a local restaurant\", and Moore was cleared. But \"the saga evaporated her life savings and stuck her £200,000 in debt\". Her career has never recovered. Sinner gets a free pass; yet when lower-ranked players face career-threatening charges, the sport does next to nothing to help.\nSome action is at least on the horizon, said Charlie Eccleshare on\nThe Athletic\n. The Professional Tennis Players Association recently announced plans to give all players access to pro-bono legal support. That may help players in Moore's situation, but won't do much to shift the general perception that tennis is a sport that gives \"preferential treatment\" to its elites. The \"two-tiered resentment\" this generates, and which Sinner's case has so clearly illustrated, \"does not look likely to fade away any time soon\".\nExplore More\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe Week UK\nLatest\nCrossword: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku hard: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku medium: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nYou might also like\nWhen 'a kiss is not a kiss': Spanish football on trial\nTalking Point\nLuis Rubiales faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail if convicted of sexually assaulting footballer Jenni Hermoso\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n15 February 25\nDenis Law obituary: fond farewell to 'the King of the Stretford End'\nIn the Spotlight\nScottish footballer who was one of Manchester United's 'Holy Trinity' has died aged 84\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n25 January 25\nWhy Man United finally lost patience with ten Hag\nTalking Point\nAfter another loss United sacked ten Hag in hopes of success in the Champion's League\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n3 November 24\nGeoff Capes obituary: shot-putter who became the World’s Strongest Man\nIn the Spotlight\nThe 'mighty figure' was a two-time Commonwealth Champion and world-record holder\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n2 November 24\nDignity in defeat\nOpinion\nChicago White Sox players during a baseball game in Detroit, Michigan\nBy Theunis Bates\nPublished\n1 October 24\nRaygun: heir to Eddie the Eagle?\nTalking Point\nAustralian Olympic breakdancer Rachael Gunn has become 'a worldwide meme'\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n24 August 24\nGraham Thorpe obituary: 'chameleon' batsman with 100 England caps\nIn depth\nCricketer's 'bottle in abundance' endeared him to fans\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n18 August 24\nBoxing at the Olympics: the row over sexual differences\nTalking Point\nControversy over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shines a spotlight on the murky world of gender testing – and the IOC's inaction\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n10 August 24\nView More ▸"

She has the power department covered, so her racquet of choice need only harness it and direct it to the intended target.\nThe Wilson Blade is the most popular racquet on the pro tours precisely because it allows players to express their games without interfering, with versatility that works from all areas of the court. It possesses top-notch control and a comfortable feel with just enough put-away power. This latest incarnation introduces StableFeel technology to increase the frameâs stability for more even more predictable shots and a bit more pop.\nAnisimova endorses the 16x19 model which has a higher launch angle and greater spin potential. The 18x20 option offers heightened command for flatter hitters.\nRead More:\nAmanda Anisimova breaks into Top 20 on WTA rankings after winning biggest title in Doha\nAnisimova uses a Wilson Blade 98 racquet and wears Nike Air Zoom Vapor 11 shoes during competition.\n©\n2025 Getty Images\nAdvertising\nApparel: NikeCourt Slam Womenâs Dri-Fit Printed Tennis Dress ($140)\nThis sporty dress is made with a stretchy, breathable jacquard fabric that keeps moisture away from your body to stay dry and comfortable.

The tongue sports a Â½ inner sleeve or bootie construction for a snug, comfortable fit without being difficult to slip on. The cushioning is a combination of a dense EVA heel, with Zoom Air underneath the forefoot. It absorbs harsh landings while still providing a connected court feel. A molded sidewall on the lateral side of the shoe that encapsulates the heel provides top-notch stability during side to side movement. And the data-informed outsole design has had rubber removed in low wear areas to keep weight at a minimum as it promotes optimal grip and sliding capabilities.\nMATCH POINT: Amanda Anisimova defeats Jelena Ostapenko in Doha final"

                "Image source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu became emotional when she saw a 'fixated' man during her second-round match in Dubai on Tuesday\nJonathan Jurejko\nBBC Sport tennis news reporter\nPublished\n21 February 2025\nBritish tennis player Emma Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting a man who had \"exhibited fixated behaviour\" was a distressing scene.\nIt provided a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.\nThe man was\ndetained by police\nfollowing the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday and given a restraining order.\n\"When you know it can get that far, that you feel a person is so obsessed with you, that they'll find a way into your court, it's very, very stressful,\" former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBBC Sport looks at why female athletes continue to hold fears, the security measures which are in place to protect them and what more can be done to ensure they feel safer.\nThe 'extra risk' faced by female athletes\nApproximately one in five women experience stalking in their lifetime, according to the UK's Office of National Statistics.\nBeing a well-known public personality increases exposure and a number of female tennis players have been subjected to predatory behaviour in recent years.\nRaducanu, 22, has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man\ngiven a five-year restraining order in 2022\nafter he walked 23 miles to her home.\nFellow British player Katie Boulter\ndescribed to the Guardian last year\n,\nexternal\nhow she had been followed by people in a car and on foot, while American players\nDanielle Collins\n,\nexternal\nand Sloane Stephens have also highlighted the harassment which they have faced.\nA man\nwas charged last month\nwith stalking American basketball player Caitlin Clark, while sprinter Gabby Thomas and rugby player Ilona Maher have recently spoken out about their fears.\nBartoli recalled a similar harrowing experience during a match at the All England Club in 2007.\nBartoli described how a man followed her throughout the British grass-court season, turning up at the Birmingham and Eastbourne events before pretending to be a member of the Wimbledon groundstaff to get nearer to her.\n\"He found a way to purchase the same kit and get himself into my courts,\" she added.\n\"I recognised him during my first-round match against Flavia Pennetta and I pointed it out straight away.\n\"I said he was not a groundsperson, he was not working there, he was someone who has been stalking me for three weeks.\"\nStephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that \"every single woman has a level of fear\".\n\"That's not restricted to the more visible women - but the more visible you are, the greater that risk is and feels,\" she said.\n\"In sport, we have the situation where your body is very much on show so it makes for extra risk.\"\nWhat happened to Raducanu in Dubai?\nRaducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.\nThe 2021 US Open champion was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.\nAfter Raducanu told the WTA about the incident, tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.\nHowever, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Karolina Muchova later that evening.\nRaducanu spotted him in the front rows of the stand behind the baseline and, having become visibly upset as she told the umpire what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowd\nRaducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she went on to lose 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.\nOn Tuesday, having left Dubai, she said she was \"doing OK\" after the \"difficult circumstances\".\nMhairi Maclennan, a British long distance runner who is the co-founder of Kyniska Advocacy, which supports women and victims of abuse in sport, believes players in Raducanu's situation should leave court for an emotional welfare assessment.\n\"Speaking from my own experience, the psychological and emotional impact of something like that happening during a competition can completely derail you,\" Maclennan told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What I would have liked to have seen in this instance, and others where an athlete has been visibly shaken, is that they pause the competition where possible.\n\"In a tennis match, make sure she is able to go and see somebody.\n\"I'm not saying the result would have been different had she been able to come back later but it is about offering her a choice.\"\nHow extra security did not stop 'deeply concerning' incident\nAccording to the WTA, players are escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.\nEnhanced security is provided if a player has been the target of a credible threat.\nThe WTA, which has a full-time security arm, says extra protection was given to Raducanu after her concerns were raised.\nTournament sources insist \"efforts\" were made to identify the man before Raducanu's match.\nHowever, questions remain about how he was allowed to enter the stadium.\nHilborne believes it is \"deeply, deeply concerning\" the man was able to get so close to Raducanu.\n\"I'm not sure what happened to the security in this instance but if an athlete has already reported someone, there should be absolutely no chance that very person can turn up in that very circumstance,\" she said.\n\"You would hope the seriousness of this situation, where a woman reports someone for that type of behaviour, means there is no chance of them getting through security.\"\nDangers of 'inadvertently overexposing female athletes'\nThe WTA says player welfare and safety is a top priority, adding that safeguarding is \"an area in which we remain ever vigilant\".\nThe governing body points to the \"significant commitments\" it has made to education and training, as well as increasing staff and resources in safeguarding.\n\"Our approach recognises that effective safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when everyone involved in the game is invested and held to the same standards,\" the WTA said.\nA key concern for both Women in Sport and Kyniska Advocacy is the effect caused by elite female athletes being used as marketing tools to push the growth of women's sports.\n\"We need to stop inadvertently overexposing elite female athletes,\" said Hilborne.\n\"It is concerning is how much they are pushed to expose their personal lives through social media and are expected to put themselves at greater risk in order to generate more income for the sport.\n\"We need to be selling the skills and jeopardy of the game, rather than the individual lives.\"\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nIn 1993, world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at a WTA event in Hamburg by a crazed male fan - an incident which is still the most notorious act of violence towards a tennis player\nAnti-misogyny policies, introduced as a condition of funding being given to sports, should also be mandatory, according to Women in Sport.\nIt has demanded social media accounts spreading misogynistic messages to be deactivated and reiterated its call for an independent sporting regulator to handle reports of misogyny.\nHilborne also wants men to \"stand up with women to address the system\".\n\"When you get a brilliant tennis player like Emma who you want to celebrate, you don't want to deal with these negative aspects - you want to celebrate their play and the story of the sport,\" said Hilborne.\n\"But when this does happen, we're reminded there has not been enough action.

                "Former No13 tennis star on front line of war witnessing deaths and ‘just trying to survive’\nFormer tennis star Aleksandr Dolgopolov has been on the front lines of the war in Ukraine, and he has opened up on the trauma he has experienced during the conflict\nAlexandr Dolgopolov has opened up on his life on the front lines of the war\n(\nImage: Getty)\nBy\nChris Burns\nSenior Sports Writer - Under 35s\nMaria Ortega\n13:47, 21 Feb 2025\n|\ncomments\nFormer\ntennis\nstar Aleksandr Dolgopolov has revealed the grim reality of the front lines since joining the Ukrainian army in response to Russia's full-scale\ninvasion\n.\nOnce a regular on the\nGrand Slam\ncircuit, Dolgopolov even reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in 2011 before retiring in 2021 after a commendable career. However, his current existence is a stark contrast to his former life, with survival now his primary goal.\nThe Ukrainian, who peaked at number 13 in the\nATP rankings\nin 2012, and regularly faced off against the likes of Roger Federer and\nNovak Djokovic\n, even defeated\nRafael Nadal\nin 2014 and 2015. But when\nRussia\n, under Vladimir Putin's command, invaded\nUkraine\nin February 2022, Dolgopolov felt compelled to act.\nA self-proclaimed patriot, he didn't hesitate to swap his tennis racket for a firearm and head to the front lines. \"My conscience drove me [saying] 'you have to do it now',\" he said. \"But I had no idea about weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in Antalya.\"\nSpeaking to German publication\nDer Spiegel\n, Dolgopolov, who now serves as a drone pilot, shared insights into his daily life at war, reports\nthe Express\n. \"Basically, I am happy to be able to defend my country, but I want nothing more than peace,\" he said.\n\"I lack inner peace and a day without news of children, civilians, and comrades being killed.\" The 36-year-old also shared some of his harrowing experiences while fighting.\nInstagram\n\"In late summer 2023, my unit was in the Zaporizhia region,\" he said. \"We were filming the terrain with a drone when suddenly we were attacked. We jumped into a trench, but the impacts came closer and shook us violently.\n\"You have to understand that if grenades of this size fall less than eight metres from you, they can tear your insides apart. In the end, all we could do was hope it wouldn't happen to us. We were scared to death. After about 20 hits it stopped. It's crazy when I think about it in retrospect.\"\nFollowing the incident, Dolgopolov was hospitalised with a concussion for a week, yet he's now haunted daily by the spectre of mortality, confessing a fear greater than death itself. \"To be honest, I am more afraid of being injured and having to live life as a cripple. If I could choose, I would prefer to be dead,\" he said.\nWhile he's managed to avoid \"direct combat\", the death he has seen through his drone camera is scarring, and the ex-ATP Tour stalwart now simply yearns to survive the ordeal.\n\"Right now I just want to survive,\" he said. \"When a friend loses a leg right before your eyes, it gives you a new perspective on life. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.\"\nTop Stories\nDon't Miss\nFollow\nMirror\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nComment\nMORE ON\nDer Spiegel\nNovak Djokovic\nRafael Nadal\nRoger Federer\nVladimir Putin\nAustralian Open\nRussia Ukraine war\nTennis\nLeading new stories from around the globe\nSign up\nInvalid Email\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

                "Sinner 'has timed it all as sweetly as one of his whiplash forehand'\n(Image credit: Andy Cheung / Contributor / Getty Images)\nBy\nThe Week UK\npublished\n22 February 2025\nNick Kyrgios called it a \"sad day for tennis\"; Tim Henman said it \"leaves a pretty sour taste\". Last Saturday, it was announced that the world's best player, Jannik Sinner, had negotiated a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over offences committed last March, and would be banned for just three months.\nSinner twice tested positive for the\nbanned steroid\nclostebol, said Stuart Fraser in\nThe Times\n. He claimed the substance had entered his system accidentally, as a result of it being present in an over-the-counter spray used by his physiotherapist to treat a small wound. And last August, a tribunal cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing. But that decision was appealed by\nWada\n, on the grounds that even if the Italian wasn't personally at fault, he was still responsible for mistakes by his team. At a hearing scheduled for April, Wada said it would seek a one-year ban. But a compromise agreement has been reached which bans Sinner until 4 May – allowing him to return for the French Open.\nThis outcome fits Sinner's interests so precisely as to almost seem like no punishment at all, said Simon Briggs in\nThe Daily Telegraph\n. Had his ban started after Wada's appeal was due to be heard, he would have missed both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. As it is, he will be able to put his feet up during the \"dog days of late winter and early spring\", before returning for the crucial summer tournaments.\nSubscribe to\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Sinner's case, and that of women's No. 2\nIga Swiatek\n(who last year received a month-long ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance), contrast starkly with that of some lower-ranked players. Take Britain's Tara Moore, who in 2022 was banned after testing positive for nandrolone metabolites and Boldenone. After 19 months of tortuous wrangling, \"the source was found to be contaminated meat at a local restaurant\", and Moore was cleared. But \"the saga evaporated her life savings and stuck her £200,000 in debt\". Her career has never recovered. Sinner gets a free pass; yet when lower-ranked players face career-threatening charges, the sport does next to nothing to help.\nSome action is at least on the horizon, said Charlie Eccleshare on\nThe Athletic\n. The Professional Tennis Players Association recently announced plans to give all players access to pro-bono legal support. That may help players in Moore's situation, but won't do much to shift the general perception that tennis is a sport that gives \"preferential treatment\" to its elites. The \"two-tiered resentment\" this generates, and which Sinner's case has so clearly illustrated, \"does not look likely to fade away any time soon\".\nExplore More\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe Week UK\nLatest\nCrossword: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku hard: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku medium: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nYou might also like\nWhen 'a kiss is not a kiss': Spanish football on trial\nTalking Point\nLuis Rubiales faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail if convicted of sexually assaulting footballer Jenni Hermoso\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n15 February 25\nDenis Law obituary: fond farewell to 'the King of the Stretford End'\nIn the Spotlight\nScottish footballer who was one of Manchester United's 'Holy Trinity' has died aged 84\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n25 January 25\nWhy Man United finally lost patience with ten Hag\nTalking Point\nAfter another loss United sacked ten Hag in hopes of success in the Champion's League\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n3 November 24\nGeoff Capes obituary: shot-putter who became the World’s Strongest Man\nIn the Spotlight\nThe 'mighty figure' was a two-time Commonwealth Champion and world-record holder\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n2 November 24\nDignity in defeat\nOpinion\nChicago White Sox players during a baseball game in Detroit, Michigan\nBy Theunis Bates\nPublished\n1 October 24\nRaygun: heir to Eddie the Eagle?\nTalking Point\nAustralian Olympic breakdancer Rachael Gunn has become 'a worldwide meme'\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n24 August 24\nGraham Thorpe obituary: 'chameleon' batsman with 100 England caps\nIn depth\nCricketer's 'bottle in abundance' endeared him to fans\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n18 August 24\nBoxing at the Olympics: the row over sexual differences\nTalking Point\nControversy over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shines a spotlight on the murky world of gender testing – and the IOC's inaction\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n10 August 24\nView More ▸"

                "Tennis sensation\nEmma Raducanu\nburst into tears during the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships after spotting a man who was later detained for exhibiting 'fixated behaviour' earlier this week. Fresh details have now emerged about the incident.\nRaducanu burst onto the tennis scene in 2021, first by reaching the fourth round of\nWimbledon\nas a wildcard in the competition before, later that year, competing in the US Open. Raducanu did not drop a single set in the entire tournament, beating Leylah Fernandez in the final at just 18 years old.\nRaducanu has not since won another major title, but in the years since her triumph, she has struggled massively with injuries, particularly in 2022 and 2023. In the Billie Jean King Cup finals last November, the tennis star made her return to competitive action, losing to Slovakia as part of Great Britain in their last four match against each other.\nRaducanu, last year, was still one of the highest-paid female athletes\non the planet despite recent injury problems.\nThe 22-year-old was competing in the Australian Open and the Dubai Tennis Championships, beating Maria Sakkari in the latter to reach the second round, where the worrying incident occurred.\n‘Fixated’ Man Taken From Raducanu Match\nHe has allegedly followed her to multiple events\nClose\nRaducanu was in the midst of her second round clash at the Dubai Tennis Championships where, after two points had been played out, the Toronto-born Brit hid behind the umpire’s chair, visibly upset, as a man was removed from the crowd by security. Charges were apparently dropped after he agreed to maintain his distance from the tennis star.\nEmma Raducanu's best Grand Slam results\nTournament\nBest result\nYear\nAustralian Open\nR3\n2025\nFrench Open\nR2\n2022\nWimbledon\nR4\n2021, 2024\nUS Open\nWinner\n2021\nRoman Kelecic, a former coach of Raducanu, has claimed that\nthe man who was arrested\nhad followed Raducanu to Singapore, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Dubai. Speaking to Croatian outlet Net,\nvia The Sun\n, he stated: “Three or four hours before the match we have a photo of that stalker. Not only us, the entire security at the tournament has his photo and everyone knows who he is.\n\"The first game, two points gone, 15-15, Emma is on the other side of the court and she’s showing us something.\n\"At that moment, we didn’t know what it was. Emma loses the first game and runs to us, crying, shouting ‘here he is, here he is, here he is.'\"\nHe added: “That was the only moment in a month where I, the fitness coach (or) the security guard who was with us, was not with her. So, that man was assessing the situation and looking for the best moment to get closer to her. He had a strategy that was terrifying, he thought everything through, calculated it.\n“It’s terrifying how much he, in essence, thought about it all and planned it. His strategy worked, and it was to get closer to her.”\nKelecic further revealed that many initially thought the man was simply a big fan of Raducanu’s, given the impact she has made on the sport and how many people know of her accomplishments. Raducanu has since thanked her opponent, Karolina Muchova, and will now look ahead to further tournaments with the hope being that the restraining order issued will be enough to keep him away from her.\nRelated\nWhat Tennis Fan Showing 'Fixated Behaviour' Actually Did to Emma Raducanu\nMore details have emerged around the fan that was escorted from a recent Emma Raducanu tennis match.\nPosts\nTennis News\nEmma Raducanu\nWimbledon News\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nClose"

Melbourne Melbourne Park Victoria Australia, EDITORIAL USE ONLY\nPUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xMikexFreyx 20250114_lbm_zg6_660\n“\nIt was too much\n, I guess, to\nhandle for me\nat the moment,”\nNovak Djokovic\nsaid after his untimely withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury. Last month, his quest for a 25th Slam faced a major setback. In the SF round against Alexander Zverev, the 24-time Major champion and 10-time AO king was forced to pull himself out of the court because of persistent pain in his leg. Fortunately, it didn’t take him long to recover and resume on-court action with the Qatar Open. But guess what? The clouds of uncertainty on his 2025 season have resurfaced. Is Djokovic okay?\nReturning from injury earlier this week, Djokovic appeared in Doha for his third ATP event of this season. However, he lost his first-round battle against Italy’s Matteo Berrettini. The World No. 35 managed to pull off a huge upset, defeating the Serbian with a score line of 7-6 (4), 6-2. Despite this result, the positive news was that Djoker didn’t sustain any more injury on the court and showed no signs of pain… until Friday.\nOn X, a clip featuring Djokovic was shared, dated February 21. It showed him entering Doha’s Hamad International Airport. But the concerning part is that he was seen limping while making his way inside. Now that’s definitely not good news for his avid fans and any tennis lover. While the video only lasted for eight seconds, it was long enough to confirm Djokovic’s pain making its way back. What’s crucial to note is that this saddening update comes just days after his R32 loss against Berrettini.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nDjokovic limping as he leaves Doha.\nNot a good look…\npic.twitter.com/DRFUfOCH6L\n— José Morgado (@josemorgado)\nFebruary 21, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nAs of now, his next ATP event appearance will surely remain doubtful. But this season of Djokovic is, somehow, turning out as a mirror image of his previous season from 7 years ago. Remember how he struggled at the start of 2018 in a similar fashion?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhen Novak Djokovic suffered setbacks in an injury-riddled season\nEven in the 2018 season, an injury ended up becoming an unwanted companion of Novak Djokovic. He failed to start the year on a winning note down under and lost against South Korea’s Chung Hyeon. Then ranked 109, Hyeon stunned Djoker in a one-sided fourth-round battle. In straight sets, he beat the 10-time AO king with a score line of 7-6, 7-5, 7-6. After his exit from Melbourne, the Serbian suffered from an elbow injury. He went to Switzerland to have surgery. Due to the recovery break, he had to miss out on the Middle East swing. But when he came back on the court, it wasn’t pleasing enough.\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, in March 2018, Japan’s Taro Daniel handed him a shocking defeat. Daniel, who entered the event as a qualifier, gave Djokovic a tough time throughout the second-round encounter. Eventually, he ousted the Serbian with a final score line of 7-6(3), 4-6, 6-1. It was their first face-off and the Japanese ATP pro succeeded in emerging victorious.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Djokovic's injury-prone phase a sign of decline, or will he rise stronger in 2025?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nAfter his loss at the Indian Wells, Djokovic was left extremely upset. Not because of the result, but his pain!\n“I was not even supposed to be here because of the surgery that was only five, six weeks ago. But I recovered very quickly, and I got myself ready. That’s it. I mean, I played like everyone else,”\nhe said in a post-match official press conference in March 2018. However, he showed a positive intent back then, while saying\n, “I have experienced many times similar situations, so I know that there is always something good in it.

                "Fernando Verdasco enjoyed a stellar ATP Tour career, winning several titles while competing against the very best in men’s tennis.\nHaving last played in 2022, Verdasco returned for this year’s\nQatar Open\n, where he planned to retire from the sport.\nCompeting alongside\nNovak Djokovic\nin the doubles tournament, the Spaniard looked to go out with one final title.\nPhoto by Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images\nThe pair dominated their opening match against\nKaren Khachanov\nand Alexander Bublik, 6-1, 6-1, to advance to the quarter-finals.\nIt was there that they took on\nAustralian Open\nchampions Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten, losing in straight sets, 5-7, 4-6.\nFollowing the match,\nVerdasco retired from tennis\n, having reached a career-high of seventh in the world, picking up seven titles.\nHe then gave his thoughts on his compatriots’ chances of breaking tennis’ most unachievable records.\nFernando Verdasco thinks it will be ‘almost impossible’ for Carlos Alcaraz to match Rafael Nadal’s Major count\nFollowing his final-ever match, Verdasco took the time to share his thoughts on two of the\nATP Tour’s\nbest young stars.\n“\n[Carlos] Alcaraz\nand [Jannik] Sinner are like Roger [Federer], Rafa [Nadal], and him [Novak Djokovic], you know,” he said.\nMore Tennis News\n“At the end they are the two biggest guys now, above the rest.\n“You can see them a bit above the rest, and you can see that they are the guys that they will be more likely fighting for the big titles over and over again.\n“Even more when Novak retires, I don’t know, maybe this year, maybe next year, whenever.\n“At the moment, they are the two guys that they look like they will be fighting over and over for every Grand Slam.”\nPhoto by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\nVerdasco thinks the world’s number one and three have already proven to be a step above their competition, reminding him of the ‘big three.’\n“Great players are also there, like Stefanos [Tsitsipas], like [Daniil] Medvedev, like [Andrey] Rublev, all these guys have been there for a few more years than\nSinner\nand Alcaraz,” he said.\n“But you can see that these two guys are made of something a bit different, you know.\n“It’s kind of like Roger, Rafa, and Novak, you could see back in the time that these guys were a bit different from the rest, you know, so that’s why they were like winning all the big titles, Grand Slams, at least, Masters maybe.”\nThe Spaniard then explained why he thinks it will be ‘almost impossible’ for Alcaraz to win as many Major titles as\nNadal\n.\nPhoto by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n“They always ask me, do you think Alcaraz is going to win the same Grand Slams as Nadal?” said Verdasco.\n“I’m like, listen, what I can say is that it’s almost impossible because, to win 22 Grand Slams, you don’t need to be so smart, it’s just that you have to be winning like two, three Grand Slams every year for like so many years.\n“So as soon as you have like maybe a surgery or maybe a physical problem, it makes it almost impossible, you know.\n“Like the average of these guys of be winning Grand Slams year after year after year is, it’s unbelievable, it’s out of this world.\n“So, obviously, for me, it’s hard to, if you tell me they will win it, nowadays when they are like 21, they have three, I see a long way to get it, you know, but who knows.”\nPhoto by Simon Bruty/Anychance/Getty Images\nIs Carlos Alcaraz on track to surpass Rafael Nadal’s 22 Grand Slam titles?\nVerdasco spoke about the rate at which Alcaraz would need to pick up Slams to win more than Nadal, but is he on track to do so?\nDuring his first four full seasons as a professional, Alcaraz won four Major titles: the 2022\nUS Open\n, 2023 Wimbledon, 2024 French Open, and 2024 Wimbledon.\nA rate of one Grand Slam a year, would likely not be enough to see the Spaniard overtake his countryman, if the pair played for the same number of years.\nName\nSlam count after 18 ‘full seasons’\nRafael Nadal\n22\nCarlos Alcaraz (projected)\n18\nCarlos Alcaraz’s projected Slam wins\nNadal played his first full season in 2005, winning the\nFrench Open\ntitle before playing all four Majors for the final time in 2022, as he won in Melbourne and at Roland Garros, taking his tally to 22.\nOnly time will tell, however, as the 21-year-old has a long way to go before he can start to think about breaking Nadal’s records.\nAlcaraz will search for a fifth Grand Slam title at the French Open, which begins on Sunday, May 25.\nATP\nCarlos Alcaraz"

It is the way he connects with his fans. Remember how he asked his fans to show him\n“some love this week, next week, and all the time”\nbefore the Indian Wells in 2021. Well, the unfortunate episode of the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the prestigious 2020 BNP Paribas Open to March 2021, but when the tournament finally returned, Tsitsipas reconnected with his fans in his unique style. Four years have gone by, and Tsitsipas equation with the fans remains the same. Fresh off his heartbreak in Qatar, after AO and Rotterdam, Tsitsipas connected with his followers expressing his gratitude again.\nAlmost a week after his quarterfinal exit from ATP Rotterdam, Tsitsipas’s campaign at the Qatar Open ended after he fell short against Hamad Medjedovic, losing by\n6-7, 7-5,\n6-7\nin R32. Before Qatar and Rotterdam, he had suffered an early exit at the Australian Open as well, losing in the first round against Alex Michelsen. In a nutshell, Tsitsipas’ 2025 season has started quite rough. However, despite these losses, the fans have stood by the Greek and Tsitsipas has nothing, but gratitude to offer.\n“\nThankful for the fans who cheer, not just for the wins, but for the journey,”\nhe posted on X after his Qatar Open exit. His form might have been a bit up and down last few months, but Tsitsipas has a big dream this season. He wants to play against Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner more often to build a constant rivalry. “\nI mean, these two, if I’m able to get a consistent rivalry with those two, that definitely shows that good things are happening for me. I have this belief that the more I play Jannik [Sinner], and Novak [Djokovic], during a year that’s actually a good problem to have and that shows that I’m going deep into the draws, and that’s definitely something that I would wish for myself,\n“\nhe said in a press conference ahead of the Dubai Tennis Championships.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThankful for the fans who cheer, not just for the wins, but for the journey.\n— Stefanos Tsitsipas (@steftsitsipas)\nFebruary 20, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nAnd the 26-year-old knows the fans will have his back. Tsitsipas has always had a special equation with the fans. Last year, he thanked his Chinese fans before the Shanghai Open and reflected on their warm reception. “\nFans here love me. They have embraced me over the years, I don’t know what it is about me that they like so much. I do feel privileged and lucky,”\nhe said.\nDespite his love for the supporters though, Tsitsipas doesn’t shy away from letting them know when their behavior is not appropriate.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nCan Tsitsipas's gratitude for fans fuel a comeback, or is he stuck in a rough patch?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nWhen Stefanos Tsitsipas urged his followers to be respectful of his opponent\nDuring his 2020 Australian Open run, Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Salvatore Caruso in the first round by\n6-0, 6-2, and 6-3.\nWhile the World No. 11 performed impressively, his victory was overshadowed by his fans’ behavior at the Margaret Court Arena. His Greek fans were quite vocal during the match, which disrupted his concentration many times. Post-victory, he addressed this issue and asked his fans to behave appropriately in the stadium.\n“\nIt is a little bit [distracting] if I would be an opponent, From their side, they should be a little bit more respectful to the opponents. They can do what they’re doing but probably with more respect. That’s all — nothing else,”\nhe said, addressing those people who kept chanting “\nOle! Ole! Stefanos Tsitsipas”\nwhile booing Caruso.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhile expressing his disagreement with fans’ behavior, Tsitsipas also thanked them for their support, reflecting on how it fueled his spirit. “\nI really like [how] they come and support me because that gives me a lot of positives in my game,”\nhe remarked.\nTsitsipas has faced some heartbreaking losses this season,\nincluding one in the Round of 32 at the Qatar Open.

Following his impressive victory over Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open finals, Zverev couldn’t help but draw a parallel to Novak Djokovic, saying,\n“He’s very, very similar to Novak when he was at his best.”\nThat’s some high praise for the young Italian! But the accolades don’t end there. WTA legend Chris Evert chimed in, noting Sinner’s maturity and poise on the court, comparing him to both Roger Federer and\nRafael Nadal\nduring their early days. However, after testing positive for clostebol in March 2024, he faced scrutiny despite being cleared once by the ITIA in August. Now, with WADA imposing a three-month ban, former ATP pro-Georges Goven is set to weigh in on the situation as discussions about fairness and support for Sinner continue to unfold.\nWhat began in March 2024 has taken quite a wild turn for World No. 1 on his journey to greatness. He first tested positive for the banned substance during his at the BNP Paribas Open. Later the ITIA cleared him on grounds of\n“no fault or negligence”\nin August, only for WADA to come in and resurface the case to be appealed before CAS which was initially announced to be held in April, however, as per WADA’s General Counsel, Ross Wenzel, who noted that the agency is\n“blind to the calendar.”\nAnd that many tests were conducted\n“12 months preceding the two positives of March”\nto explain why Sinner’s case was resolved the way it was.\nHowever, that doesn’t seem to appease the players like Nick Krygios, and Novak Djokovic or the fans who have noted that the system displayed impartial treatment and\n“favoritism\n” in the light of Sinner’s case. To add to that narrative, the former 56th player in the world, Georges Goven added his take by drawing a comparison to the Italian with that of the Spanish GOAT Rafael Nadal.\nHe said\n,\n“Rafael Nadal has been tested more than 400 times in his life, he has never had anything. There, there were two positive tests, that’s the difference.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nvia Getty\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK – AUGUST 23: Jannik Sinner of Italy speaks to the media during a press conference ahead of the 2024 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on August 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\nWhile analysts have compared Sinner’s playing style and attitude on the court, they are most likely reserved to Novak and Federer. Albeit, a former Italian player Corrado Barazzutti once noted that\n“He plays at the level of a young Djokovic, a young Nadal, a young Federer.”\nBut with his doping ban, it seems like his legacy is about to be tainted unlike that of the three legends who have never tested positive during the course of their careers.\nThis was emphasized by Goven but was straightforward in his admission,\n“We all agree that Sinner is a good person, interesting, calm, charismatic even if his game is not always very spectacular. But there will always be the fact that he tested positive twice, which has never happened to Nadal.”\nWhile that may be true, it doesn’t mean that the Spaniard didn’t face his share of controversies in his time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn 2012, Nadal faced allegations from former French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot, who suggested that his seven-month injury break was due to a failed drug test. To defend his reputation, Nadal filed a defamation suit against Bachelot and emerged victorious, resulting in her being fined €500 (approximately $524.03) and ordered to pay him €12,000 (about $12,480.60) in damages and legal fees. Nadal graciously donated the compensation to charity, emphasizing his commitment to clean sport and the values he upholds throughout his career. Moreover, when Jannik’s case surfaced, Rafa showed his support to the Italian.\nRafael Nadal showed his support for Jannik during doping controversy\nIn September, Rafa expressed his support for Sinner in an interview with El Hormiguero, stating,\n“I trust that if he has not been sanctioned it is because those who have had to judge this case have clearly seen that what happened was not punishable.”\nHe emphasized that opinions vary but stood firmly behind the regulatory bodies’ decision.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nCan Jannik Sinner's talent overshadow the doping controversy, or will it forever taint his legacy?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nThe ITIA investigated and held a hearing in August, ultimately accepting Sinner’s explanation that the banned substance entered his system unintentionally. Sinner revealed that his physiotherapist had used a spray containing the substance during a massage, leading to the accidental doping violation. The ITIA concluded that Sinner did not intentionally violate any doping regulations and decided against imposing a period of ineligibility. However, despite being cleared initially, Sinner recently accepted a three-month ban from February 9 to May 4, 2025, following a settlement with WADA.\nAs the conversation surrounding Sinner’s case continues to ignite on social media, he faces the music ahead of his return just in time for the 2025 French Open.

He announced himself in style by defeating Andrey Rublev in straight sets but was beaten by Lorenzo Sonego in his next match.\nFonseca's brilliant display against Rublev drew public praise from Djokovic, who tipped him to enjoy a bright future if he continues to develop on the same trajectory.\nHowever, the young Brazilian has risked angering his veteran rival by insisting that Federer is the greatest player in tennis history.\nNovak Djokovic spotted limping in fresh injury worry after Qatar Open exit\nEmma Raducanu's coach recalls terrifying moment she spotted 'stalker' at match\nThe young Brazilian nailed his colours to the mast when quizzed on the age-old debate\n(Image: GETTY)\nStay up-to-date with the latest Tennis news\nJoin us on WhatsApp\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Djokovic may be the best of all time, but Federer is the greatest. He has no rival.\"\nDjokovic has won more Grand Slam titles than any other player in history, making him the statistical choice when it comes to picking the greatest player of all time.\nPersonal preference also comes into the debate at times, though, with Federer and\nRafael Nadal\nhaving millions of backers despite failing to win as many trophies as Djokovic.\nFonseca previously revealed that he idolised Federer while growing up, saying at the\nAustralian Open\n: \"My idol was always Roger.

The fact that players like\nNovak Djokovic\nand\nCarlos Alcaraz\ntalk about me gives me the confidence to go even further.\n\"Wow, Alcaraz said that about me, Djokovic said that about me. It means I'm on the right track. It's gratifying to hear these comments from such important people in our sport.\"\nFonseca's next outing will be at Indian Wells, where he has received a wildcard into the main draw. It will mark his second time competing at an ATP Masters 1000 event, with his first appearance coming at last year's Madrid Open."

Melbourne Melbourne Park Victoria Australia, EDITORIAL USE ONLY\nPUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xMikexFreyx 20250114_lbm_zg6_660\n“\nIt was too much\n, I guess, to\nhandle for me\nat the moment,”\nNovak Djokovic\nsaid after his untimely withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury. Last month, his quest for a 25th Slam faced a major setback. In the SF round against Alexander Zverev, the 24-time Major champion and 10-time AO king was forced to pull himself out of the court because of persistent pain in his leg. Fortunately, it didn’t take him long to recover and resume on-court action with the Qatar Open. But guess what? The clouds of uncertainty on his 2025 season have resurfaced. Is Djokovic okay?\nReturning from injury earlier this week, Djokovic appeared in Doha for his third ATP event of this season. However, he lost his first-round battle against Italy’s Matteo Berrettini. The World No. 35 managed to pull off a huge upset, defeating the Serbian with a score line of 7-6 (4), 6-2. Despite this result, the positive news was that Djoker didn’t sustain any more injury on the court and showed no signs of pain… until Friday.\nOn X, a clip featuring Djokovic was shared, dated February 21. It showed him entering Doha’s Hamad International Airport. But the concerning part is that he was seen limping while making his way inside. Now that’s definitely not good news for his avid fans and any tennis lover. While the video only lasted for eight seconds, it was long enough to confirm Djokovic’s pain making its way back. What’s crucial to note is that this saddening update comes just days after his R32 loss against Berrettini.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nDjokovic limping as he leaves Doha.\nNot a good look…\npic.twitter.com/DRFUfOCH6L\n— José Morgado (@josemorgado)\nFebruary 21, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nAs of now, his next ATP event appearance will surely remain doubtful. But this season of Djokovic is, somehow, turning out as a mirror image of his previous season from 7 years ago. Remember how he struggled at the start of 2018 in a similar fashion?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhen Novak Djokovic suffered setbacks in an injury-riddled season\nEven in the 2018 season, an injury ended up becoming an unwanted companion of Novak Djokovic. He failed to start the year on a winning note down under and lost against South Korea’s Chung Hyeon. Then ranked 109, Hyeon stunned Djoker in a one-sided fourth-round battle. In straight sets, he beat the 10-time AO king with a score line of 7-6, 7-5, 7-6. After his exit from Melbourne, the Serbian suffered from an elbow injury. He went to Switzerland to have surgery. Due to the recovery break, he had to miss out on the Middle East swing. But when he came back on the court, it wasn’t pleasing enough.\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, in March 2018, Japan’s Taro Daniel handed him a shocking defeat. Daniel, who entered the event as a qualifier, gave Djokovic a tough time throughout the second-round encounter. Eventually, he ousted the Serbian with a final score line of 7-6(3), 4-6, 6-1. It was their first face-off and the Japanese ATP pro succeeded in emerging victorious.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Djokovic's injury-prone phase a sign of decline, or will he rise stronger in 2025?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nAfter his loss at the Indian Wells, Djokovic was left extremely upset. Not because of the result, but his pain!\n“I was not even supposed to be here because of the surgery that was only five, six weeks ago. But I recovered very quickly, and I got myself ready. That’s it. I mean, I played like everyone else,”\nhe said in a post-match official press conference in March 2018. However, he showed a positive intent back then, while saying\n, “I have experienced many times similar situations, so I know that there is always something good in it. You just need to try to set your mind at that frequency.”\nAt this point, too, Djokovic is suffering from a similar phase once again. Hopefully, he will bounce back in a strong way with a timely recovery. What are your thoughts on his prospects going forward in 2025?

                "The world number one will be out of action for several months as he serves his suspension.\n2025 couldn’t have started any better for the Italian star, as he defended his title at the\nAustralian Open\n.\nJannik Sinner beat Alexander Zverev\nin the final, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, as he clinched his third Grand Slam, dropping just two sets all tournament.\nPhoto by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\nThe 23-year-old had been set to return to action at this week’s\nQatar Open\nin Doha before news broke ahead of the tournament that sent the tennis world into a frenzy.\nSinner accepted a three-month ban\nfor doping violations he committed in 2024, testing positive for the banned substance Clostebol.\nWorld number one\nSinner\nwill miss four Masters 1000 events while serving his suspension but should return for his home Italian Open, and the French Open in May.\nMany have questioned the timing and length of his ban, and three former American\nATP Tour\nstars have now commented on the controversy.\nJack Sock thinks Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban is ‘ridiculous’ and says it ‘doesn’t make sense’\nSpeaking on the Nothing Major podcast, former world number eight\nJack Sock\n, shared his thoughts on Sinner’s ban.\n“I think it’s bull——,” he said.\n“The whole thing is ridiculous to me.\n“I don’t think you can have a Mikael Ymer-type player who gets suspended for a year or two and has to retire from the sport because he missed three tests and then you have a player, just because he’s a top player, fail a drug test and only get three months.\nMore Tennis News\n“It doesn’t make sense to me.\n“Because you didn’t show up to the right location three times and you are out for two years, compared to three months for failing a thing.\n“The whole blaming it on the team, you are the main piece of the team, you need to be in the know of what is going on.”\nPhoto by Graham Denholm/Getty Images\nSock’s co-host\nSam Querrey\nsuggested that the timing of Sinner’s ban certainly seemed ‘convenient.’\n“I don’t think most players are mad or disappointed with [Jannik] Sinner,” he said.\n“I think they are disappointed with WADA [World Anti-Doping Agency] or the drug testing as a whole.\n“The inconsistency of it or the timing, it needs some type of overhaul or some type of way to make the rules more black and white.\n“It’s easier said than done, but it seemed a little too convenient, he gets to come back and play Rome, he is still going to be ranked number one in the world.”\nSinner’s ban ends just days before his home\nItalian Open\nkicks off in May, an event that hasn’t been kind to the world number one during his career so far.\nWin % ranking\nTournament\nWin %\nBest result\nMost recent result\n1\nShanghai Masters\n89\nW – 2024\nW –

performances at Masters 1000 events\nQuerrey then explained how Sinner would feel about the timing of his three-month ban.\n“If you are Sinner it’s great, you get to move on and don’t have to deal with this saga anymore.\n“I assume he is loving the end result of this but WADA is the one who comes out looking like a loser in this whole thing.”\nFellow American\nSteve Johnson\nthen suggested what the relevant authorities need to do, to avoid similar controversies from happening again.\nPhoto by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n“I think we need a complete overhaul of the drug testing system, the rules,” he said.\n“It is not fair from top to bottom.\n“From the suspension side of things, to the testing side of things.\n“Whether he did or didn’t do it is way out of my pay grade, but I don’t like that the suspension comes now for three months.\n“He just misses a couple of Masters series, he gets to play Rome, he gets to play the\nFrench Open\n, he gets to play Wimbledon and that part I don’t like.”\nWho is Mikael Ymer and why was he banned from tennis?\nAs Sock mentioned, plenty of ATP stars have been banned for far longer than Sinner, for arguably less severe violations.\nOne such player was Swedish 26-year-old Mikael Ymer, who received an 18-month competition ban in 2023 for missing three tests in a 12-month period.\nPhoto by Michael Campanella/Getty Images for ITF\nOnce ranked 50th in the world, Ymer retired from tennis following the news before reversing his decision one year later.\nYmer returned in January 2025, winning an ITF tournament in Luxembourg, and is now ranked 794th, as he continues his comeback.\nSome tennis fans may recognize Ymer as the man who beat\nCarlos Alcaraz\nin his first Grand Slam tournament, in Melbourne four years ago.\nHaving beaten\nBotic van de Zandschulp\nin the first round, the Spaniard took on Ymer for a place in the third round.\nYmer proved too much for the young star, taking him down in four sets to advance to the last 32 of a Major tournament for the first time in his career.\nThe Swede will look to rediscover that form as he continues to build fitness following his 18-month ban from tennis.\nATP\nJack Sock\nJannik Sinner\nSam Querrey"

                "Former No13 tennis star on front line of war witnessing deaths and ‘just trying to survive’\nFormer tennis star Aleksandr Dolgopolov has been on the front lines of the war in Ukraine, and he has opened up on the trauma he has experienced during the conflict\nAlexandr Dolgopolov has opened up on his life on the front lines of the war\n(\nImage: Getty)\nBy\nChris Burns\nSenior Sports Writer - Under 35s\nMaria Ortega\n13:47, 21 Feb 2025\n|\ncomments\nFormer\ntennis\nstar Aleksandr Dolgopolov has revealed the grim reality of the front lines since joining the Ukrainian army in response to Russia's full-scale\ninvasion\n.\nOnce a regular on the\nGrand Slam\ncircuit, Dolgopolov even reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in 2011 before retiring in 2021 after a commendable career. However, his current existence is a stark contrast to his former life, with survival now his primary goal.\nThe Ukrainian, who peaked at number 13 in the\nATP rankings\nin 2012, and regularly faced off against the likes of Roger Federer and\nNovak Djokovic\n, even defeated\nRafael Nadal\nin 2014 and 2015. But when\nRussia\n, under Vladimir Putin's command, invaded\nUkraine\nin February 2022, Dolgopolov felt compelled to act.\nA self-proclaimed patriot, he didn't hesitate to swap his tennis racket for a firearm and head to the front lines. \"My conscience drove me [saying] 'you have to do it now',\" he said. \"But I had no idea about weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in Antalya.\"\nSpeaking to German publication\nDer Spiegel\n, Dolgopolov, who now serves as a drone pilot, shared insights into his daily life at war, reports\nthe Express\n. \"Basically, I am happy to be able to defend my country, but I want nothing more than peace,\" he said.\n\"I lack inner peace and a day without news of children, civilians, and comrades being killed.\" The 36-year-old also shared some of his harrowing experiences while fighting.\nInstagram\n\"In late summer 2023, my unit was in the Zaporizhia region,\" he said. \"We were filming the terrain with a drone when suddenly we were attacked. We jumped into a trench, but the impacts came closer and shook us violently.\n\"You have to understand that if grenades of this size fall less than eight metres from you, they can tear your insides apart. In the end, all we could do was hope it wouldn't happen to us. We were scared to death. After about 20 hits it stopped. It's crazy when I think about it in retrospect.\"\nFollowing the incident, Dolgopolov was hospitalised with a concussion for a week, yet he's now haunted daily by the spectre of mortality, confessing a fear greater than death itself. \"To be honest, I am more afraid of being injured and having to live life as a cripple. If I could choose, I would prefer to be dead,\" he said.\nWhile he's managed to avoid \"direct combat\", the death he has seen through his drone camera is scarring, and the ex-ATP Tour stalwart now simply yearns to survive the ordeal.\n\"Right now I just want to survive,\" he said. \"When a friend loses a leg right before your eyes, it gives you a new perspective on life. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.\"\nTop Stories\nDon't Miss\nFollow\nMirror\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nComment\nMORE ON\nDer Spiegel\nNovak Djokovic\nRafael Nadal\nRoger Federer\nVladimir Putin\nAustralian Open\nRussia Ukraine war\nTennis\nLeading new stories from around the globe\nSign up\nInvalid Email\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

The women\nwill descend on The Queen’s Club for the HSBC Championships in June.\nAustralian Open\nchampion Madison Keys is among the s\nelect star-studded lineup\nthat has already been announced, and the world No. 6 has made a big sacrifice to compete in the event.\nTournament director\nLaura Robson\ntold\nExpress Sport\nthat Keys was refusing to take her usual trip home to America so she could support the new tournament.\nMadison Keys' wedding to coach was 'too civilised' as Robson spills the beans\nBritish tennis fans can see Emma Raducanu in action from £20 at new London event\nAlong with\nEmma Raducanu\n,\nKatie Boulter\n,\nNaomi Osaka\nand Daria Kasatkina, the tour’s newest Grand Slam champion has signed up for the WTA 500 at The Queen’s Club.\nKeys is a seasoned grass-court player - she has lifted titles in Birmingham and Eastbourne. But the 30-year-old has never competed in the week of the grass season, which comes immediately after the French Open.\nFor American players like Keys, the back-to-back clay and grass swing means they spend almost three months away from home if they don’t take a week out to fly back.\nThe world No. 6 has traditionally used the week after the French Open to return to the United States. But she has given up her time at home so she can compete at Queen’s.\nLaura Robson is the tournament director for the WTA HSBC Championships\n(Image: Getty)\nStay up-to-date with the latest Tennis news\nJoin us on WhatsApp\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

They first met at under-12s competitions, and barely a day has passed since then without them being in touch.\nWhile Keys was always keen to come and support Robson and the WTA 500 in Queen’s, the tournament team arranged the Aussie Open winner’s appearance through her agent.\nSUBSCRIBE\nInvalid email\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

                "Image source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu became emotional when she saw a 'fixated' man during her second-round match in Dubai on Tuesday\nJonathan Jurejko\nBBC Sport tennis news reporter\nPublished\n21 February 2025\nBritish tennis player Emma Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting a man who had \"exhibited fixated behaviour\" was a distressing scene.\nIt provided a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.\nThe man was\ndetained by police\nfollowing the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday and given a restraining order.\n\"When you know it can get that far, that you feel a person is so obsessed with you, that they'll find a way into your court, it's very, very stressful,\" former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBBC Sport looks at why female athletes continue to hold fears, the security measures which are in place to protect them and what more can be done to ensure they feel safer.\nThe 'extra risk' faced by female athletes\nApproximately one in five women experience stalking in their lifetime, according to the UK's Office of National Statistics.\nBeing a well-known public personality increases exposure and a number of female tennis players have been subjected to predatory behaviour in recent years.\nRaducanu, 22, has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man\ngiven a five-year restraining order in 2022\nafter he walked 23 miles to her home.\nFellow British player Katie Boulter\ndescribed to the Guardian last year\n,\nexternal\nhow she had been followed by people in a car and on foot, while American players\nDanielle Collins\n,\nexternal\nand Sloane Stephens have also highlighted the harassment which they have faced.\nA man\nwas charged last month\nwith stalking American basketball player Caitlin Clark, while sprinter Gabby Thomas and rugby player Ilona Maher have recently spoken out about their fears.\nBartoli recalled a similar harrowing experience during a match at the All England Club in 2007.\nBartoli described how a man followed her throughout the British grass-court season, turning up at the Birmingham and Eastbourne events before pretending to be a member of the Wimbledon groundstaff to get nearer to her.\n\"He found a way to purchase the same kit and get himself into my courts,\" she added.\n\"I recognised him during my first-round match against Flavia Pennetta and I pointed it out straight away.\n\"I said he was not a groundsperson, he was not working there, he was someone who has been stalking me for three weeks.\"\nStephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that \"every single woman has a level of fear\".\n\"That's not restricted to the more visible women - but the more visible you are, the greater that risk is and feels,\" she said.\n\"In sport, we have the situation where your body is very much on show so it makes for extra risk.\"\nWhat happened to Raducanu in Dubai?\nRaducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.\nThe 2021 US Open champion was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.\nAfter Raducanu told the WTA about the incident, tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.\nHowever, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Karolina Muchova later that evening.\nRaducanu spotted him in the front rows of the stand behind the baseline and, having become visibly upset as she told the umpire what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowd\nRaducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she went on to lose 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.\nOn Tuesday, having left Dubai, she said she was \"doing OK\" after the \"difficult circumstances\".\nMhairi Maclennan, a British long distance runner who is the co-founder of Kyniska Advocacy, which supports women and victims of abuse in sport, believes players in Raducanu's situation should leave court for an emotional welfare assessment.\n\"Speaking from my own experience, the psychological and emotional impact of something like that happening during a competition can completely derail you,\" Maclennan told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What I would have liked to have seen in this instance, and others where an athlete has been visibly shaken, is that they pause the competition where possible.\n\"In a tennis match, make sure she is able to go and see somebody.\n\"I'm not saying the result would have been different had she been able to come back later but it is about offering her a choice.\"\nHow extra security did not stop 'deeply concerning' incident\nAccording to the WTA, players are escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.\nEnhanced security is provided if a player has been the target of a credible threat.\nThe WTA, which has a full-time security arm, says extra protection was given to Raducanu after her concerns were raised.\nTournament sources insist \"efforts\" were made to identify the man before Raducanu's match.\nHowever, questions remain about how he was allowed to enter the stadium.\nHilborne believes it is \"deeply, deeply concerning\" the man was able to get so close to Raducanu.\n\"I'm not sure what happened to the security in this instance but if an athlete has already reported someone, there should be absolutely no chance that very person can turn up in that very circumstance,\" she said.\n\"You would hope the seriousness of this situation, where a woman reports someone for that type of behaviour, means there is no chance of them getting through security.\"\nDangers of 'inadvertently overexposing female athletes'\nThe WTA says player welfare and safety is a top priority, adding that safeguarding is \"an area in which we remain ever vigilant\".\nThe governing body points to the \"significant commitments\" it has made to education and training, as well as increasing staff and resources in safeguarding.\n\"Our approach recognises that effective safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when everyone involved in the game is invested and held to the same standards,\" the WTA said.\nA key concern for both Women in Sport and Kyniska Advocacy is the effect caused by elite female athletes being used as marketing tools to push the growth of women's sports.\n\"We need to stop inadvertently overexposing elite female athletes,\" said Hilborne.\n\"It is concerning is how much they are pushed to expose their personal lives through social media and are expected to put themselves at greater risk in order to generate more income for the sport.\n\"We need to be selling the skills and jeopardy of the game, rather than the individual lives.\"\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nIn 1993, world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at a WTA event in Hamburg by a crazed male fan - an incident which is still the most notorious act of violence towards a tennis player\nAnti-misogyny policies, introduced as a condition of funding being given to sports, should also be mandatory, according to Women in Sport.\nIt has demanded social media accounts spreading misogynistic messages to be deactivated and reiterated its call for an independent sporting regulator to handle reports of misogyny.\nHilborne also wants men to \"stand up with women to address the system\".\n\"When you get a brilliant tennis player like Emma who you want to celebrate, you don't want to deal with these negative aspects - you want to celebrate their play and the story of the sport,\" said Hilborne.\n\"But when this does happen, we're reminded there has not been enough action.

He failed to birdie two of the shorter par 5s on the back nine. He still had an outside chance at another sub-60 round, having shot 59 on the Korn Ferry Tour a year ago.\nThose hopes ended with a tee shot into the bunker on the par-5 18th hole, and an approach that came up short into a bunker. The ball stayed near the lip, making it difficult for him to get the 20-yard bunker shot close. He two-putted from 25 feet for par.\n\"But it was OK,\" he said of the par. \"I knew I made a lot of extra birdies throughout the day where that wasn't going to hurt me.\"\nPeople are also reading…\nShatel: John Cook gives update on his busy retirement life and future Nebraska plans\nNebraska trooper identified, among 2 killed in 'numerous' snow-related crashes Monday\nWas an Omaha surgeon charged in a deadly crash road racing or unconscious?\nOmaha man first in Nebraska to file federal lawsuit challenging legality of DOGE\nHomeless woman, 40, found dead inside tent in east Omaha\nPolice identify Fremont woman killed in crash on West Dodge Road\nFred Hoiberg cuts hand during halftime 'incident with a whiteboard'\nPapillion woman dragged 15-year-old daughter with car, affidavit alleges\nOmaha mayoral candidate calls city homeless coordinator 'DEI hire,' promises to fire her\nNebraska-Tennessee football series off as NU plans Memorial Stadium renovation\nFormer CHI Health doctor charged with child sex crimes\nJordy Bahl's gem leads Nebraska softball past Baylor; Husker in concussion protocol\nOmaha hotel employees knew about child sex trafficking scheme, detective says in court\nKirk Peterson not returning as Millard West football coach in 2025\nIf you're headed to Omaha's Eppley Airfield, get ready for split concourses\nPotgieter tied the course record and was at 16-under 126, four shots ahead of Stephan Jaeger (64) and Brian Campbell, who birdied his last hole for a second straight 65.\nIt was superb display for Potgieter, who won the 2022 British Amateur at age 17 and last year became the youngest player (19) to win on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\"I love the golf course. It definitely suits my game, I think, in a lot of aspects,\" Potgieter said. \"If I can keep putting well, I think it should be pretty good.\"\nHis power and ball-striking stand out. His putter is what led to the 61, with Potgieter holing seven putts from the 10-foot range or longer. That doesn't include the 10th, where his tee shot found the water, he came up just short of the green and chipped in from 20 feet for par.\nHe reached the 661-yard 12th hole in two by hitting driver off the fairway to just over 20 feet.\n\"I've been practicing, doing a drill on the driving range with teeing it really low and hitting it really good with the driver that way,\" Potgieter said. \"I was telling my caddie, 'Let's just do the same thing.' It was a perfect number, so yeah, hit the perfect shot.\"\nSeven of his drives went 325 yards or longer.\nJaeger had another bogey on one of the five par 5s, this time by hitting wedge over the green at No. 12, and still managed a 64 to stay in the mix. He had six birdies on his last 10 holes.\n\"It's one of those golf courses I feel like if you hit it nicely and you give yourself a lot of chances, the greens are so good it's nice to make some putts,\" he said.\nAaron Rai of England, the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 29, had a 64 and was five shots behind.\nAntoine Rozner came to his final hole needing birdie to move the cut line and knock out 12 players. Rozner had to make a 10-foot par to avoid missing the cut himself.\nTwo Masters-bound amateurs were among the 77 players who made the cut at 3-under 138. Latin America Amateur champion Justin Hastings of the Cayman Islands birdied three of his last four holes for a 67 and was at 136. U.S. Amateur champion Jose Luis Ballester shot another 69 and was at 138.\nAlso making the cut was Blades Brown, the 17-year-old who turned pro this year. He shot 69 and was 11 shots out of the lead.\n0\nComments\nBe the first to know\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\nSign up!\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and\nprivacy policy\n.\nRelated to this story\nMost Popular\nShatel: John Cook gives update on his busy retirement life and future Nebraska plans\nFormer Nebraska volleyball coach John Cook got a rude awakening to the concept of retirement of a coaching legend.

                "Sinner 'has timed it all as sweetly as one of his whiplash forehand'\n(Image credit: Andy Cheung / Contributor / Getty Images)\nBy\nThe Week UK\npublished\n22 February 2025\nNick Kyrgios called it a \"sad day for tennis\"; Tim Henman said it \"leaves a pretty sour taste\". Last Saturday, it was announced that the world's best player, Jannik Sinner, had negotiated a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over offences committed last March, and would be banned for just three months.\nSinner twice tested positive for the\nbanned steroid\nclostebol, said Stuart Fraser in\nThe Times\n. He claimed the substance had entered his system accidentally, as a result of it being present in an over-the-counter spray used by his physiotherapist to treat a small wound. And last August, a tribunal cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing. But that decision was appealed by\nWada\n, on the grounds that even if the Italian wasn't personally at fault, he was still responsible for mistakes by his team. At a hearing scheduled for April, Wada said it would seek a one-year ban. But a compromise agreement has been reached which bans Sinner until 4 May – allowing him to return for the French Open.\nThis outcome fits Sinner's interests so precisely as to almost seem like no punishment at all, said Simon Briggs in\nThe Daily Telegraph\n. Had his ban started after Wada's appeal was due to be heard, he would have missed both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. As it is, he will be able to put his feet up during the \"dog days of late winter and early spring\", before returning for the crucial summer tournaments.\nSubscribe to\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Sinner's case, and that of women's No. 2\nIga Swiatek\n(who last year received a month-long ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance), contrast starkly with that of some lower-ranked players. Take Britain's Tara Moore, who in 2022 was banned after testing positive for nandrolone metabolites and Boldenone. After 19 months of tortuous wrangling, \"the source was found to be contaminated meat at a local restaurant\", and Moore was cleared. But \"the saga evaporated her life savings and stuck her £200,000 in debt\". Her career has never recovered. Sinner gets a free pass; yet when lower-ranked players face career-threatening charges, the sport does next to nothing to help.\nSome action is at least on the horizon, said Charlie Eccleshare on\nThe Athletic\n. The Professional Tennis Players Association recently announced plans to give all players access to pro-bono legal support. That may help players in Moore's situation, but won't do much to shift the general perception that tennis is a sport that gives \"preferential treatment\" to its elites. The \"two-tiered resentment\" this generates, and which Sinner's case has so clearly illustrated, \"does not look likely to fade away any time soon\".\nExplore More\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe Week UK\nLatest\nCrossword: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku hard: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku medium: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nYou might also like\nWhen 'a kiss is not a kiss': Spanish football on trial\nTalking Point\nLuis Rubiales faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail if convicted of sexually assaulting footballer Jenni Hermoso\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n15 February 25\nDenis Law obituary: fond farewell to 'the King of the Stretford End'\nIn the Spotlight\nScottish footballer who was one of Manchester United's 'Holy Trinity' has died aged 84\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n25 January 25\nWhy Man United finally lost patience with ten Hag\nTalking Point\nAfter another loss United sacked ten Hag in hopes of success in the Champion's League\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n3 November 24\nGeoff Capes obituary: shot-putter who became the World’s Strongest Man\nIn the Spotlight\nThe 'mighty figure' was a two-time Commonwealth Champion and world-record holder\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n2 November 24\nDignity in defeat\nOpinion\nChicago White Sox players during a baseball game in Detroit, Michigan\nBy Theunis Bates\nPublished\n1 October 24\nRaygun: heir to Eddie the Eagle?\nTalking Point\nAustralian Olympic breakdancer Rachael Gunn has become 'a worldwide meme'\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n24 August 24\nGraham Thorpe obituary: 'chameleon' batsman with 100 England caps\nIn depth\nCricketer's 'bottle in abundance' endeared him to fans\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n18 August 24\nBoxing at the Olympics: the row over sexual differences\nTalking Point\nControversy over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shines a spotlight on the murky world of gender testing – and the IOC's inaction\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n10 August 24\nView More ▸"

This year’s Qatar Open has lived up to expectations. It’s been a tournament of upsets. From\nNovak Djokovic’s shocking crash\nagainst Matteo Berrettini in the first round to World No.3 Carlos Alcaraz’s quarterfinal exit against World No.23 Jiri Lehecka, Doha has it all.! It makes sense as Doha’s long-running hard-court event has officially leveled up to an\nATP 500\n, making it an even bigger stop on the tour calendar. And when the status goes up, so does the money. And\nATP stars\nJack Draper\nand\nAndrey Rublev\nare ready to fight it out today in the finals of the tournament. How much is the prize money they are fighting for?\nAccording to the\nATP Tour\n, the prize pool for the 2025 Qatar Open has surged to $2,760,000, marking a staggering 97.73% increase from last year. The champion will take home an impressive $516,165, a massive 143.13% increase compared to what Karen Khachanov earned when he lifted the title in 2024. Even the runner-up won’t be leaving empty-handed, securing $277,715, which represents a 124.25% jump from what last year’s finalist received.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nHere’s a complete breakdown of the prize money for the singles category:\nWinner\n500\n$516,165\nFinals\n330\n$277,715\nSF\n200\n$148,005\nQuarter Finals\n100\n$75,615\nRound 16\n50\n$40,365\nRound 32\n0\n$21,525\nSo, no matter what happens in today’s final,\nJack Draper and Andrey Rublev have already secured $563,225 and 680 ranking points\n. But only one of them will take home the trophy and $516,165. So who will take this prize purse home?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nCan Jack Draper defy the odds and claim his first ATP title against Rublev's experience?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nThe road to the final for Andrey Rublev and Jack Draper\nAndrey Rublev, ranked\nNo. 10 in the world\n, moved past Alexander Bublik and Nuno Borges in the first two rounds. The Russian the faced Alex de Minaur in a close 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (8) match.\nHe had to dig deep in his semifinal against Félix Auger-Aliassime\n. The Russian needed\nfour match points\nto finally close out the nearly\nthree-hour battle\n, but he got the job done. Doha is familiar territory for him—he was a\nfinalist in 2018\nand\nwon the title in 2020\n. Now, he’s back with a chance to reclaim the crown.\nOn the other side of the net,\nJack Draper, ranked No. 16\n, had to fight Alexei Popyrin and Christopher O’Connell in the first two rounds. The Brit made a stunning comeback from one set down in the third round against Matteo Berettini to earn his place in the semi-final. He had a thrilling encounter with\nJiri Lehecka in the semifinal.\nAfter dropping the first set, he rallied back to win\n3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3\n. This will be\nhis first Qatar Open final and the fifth final of his career\n. But if history is any indication, Draper has an uphill battle as the Russian tennis star\nleads their head-to-head 3-0\n.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nBeyond the hefty prize money, this match is about legacy. The World No. 10\nis chasing his 16th ATP title\n, and another win in Doha would further cement his status as one of the tour’s most consistent top players.

They immediately requested Bergs’ disqualification.\nAn independent doctor ruled Garin was fit to continue and serve to stay in the match. He refused and after three warnings for time violations, lost the decisive game without leaving his seat.\nThe Chilean Tennis Federation (FTC) quickly denounced the result as an “injustice” and said they would contest it.\nLate on Wednesday, the FTC announced on its Instagram account that it had filed an official “action” with the ITF following what it described as “serious irregularities”.\nIt complained of “a failure to apply the rules after serious physical contact”, “irrational and arbitrary” officiating and “medical negligence”.\nIt called for the “immediate suspension” of the draw scheduled for the following day, asking that the tie be replayed or Chile granted a “wild card” to the Davis Cup finals. It also called for “sanctions” against Bergs.\nComments\nRelated Topics\nDavis Cup\n/\nChile\n/\nITF\nLatest on Sportstar\nLive Blog\n2025-02-21T12:33:38+05:30\nSouth Africa vs Afghanistan Live Score, Champions Trophy 2025: AFG 169/8 (38); Rahmat Shah hits fifty; Ngidi gets Naib\nTeam Sportstar\n71st Senior National Kabaddi C’ships: Services, Karnataka, Punjab, and Haryana move closer to knockouts on Day 2\nTeam Sportstar\nLive Blog\n2025-02-21T18:00:48+05:30\nRCB vs MI, WPL 2025 LIVE updates: Mumbai Indians loses early wicket in 168 chase vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru\nTeam Sportstar\nREAD MORE STORIES\nREAD THE LATEST ISSUE\nOff-side: Governing sports in the age of superstars\nAyon Sengupta\nICC Champions Trophy 2025: A tournament to celebrate, a test to pass\nShayan Acharya\n+ SEE all Stories\nMore on Tennis\nDavis Cup draw postponed as Chile protests Belgian knockout win\nAFP\nJannik Sinner out of Las Vegas exhibition due to doping ban; Casper Ruud named as replacement\nAP\nQatar Open 2025: Jiri Lehecka stuns Carlos Alcaraz in quarters\nAP\nREAD MORE STORIES\nLatest on Sportstar\nLive Blog\n2025-02-21T12:33:38+05:30\nSouth Africa vs Afghanistan Live Score, Champions Trophy 2025: AFG 169/8 (38); Rahmat Shah hits fifty; Ngidi gets Naib\nTeam Sportstar\n71st Senior National Kabaddi C’ships: Services, Karnataka, Punjab, and Haryana move closer to knockouts on Day 2\nTeam Sportstar\nLive Blog\n2025-02-21T18:00:48+05:30\nRCB vs MI, WPL 2025 LIVE updates: Mumbai Indians loses early wicket in 168 chase vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru\nTeam Sportstar\nREAD MORE STORIES\nSign in to unlock all user benefits\nGet notified on top games and events\nSave stories to read later\nAccess to comment on every story\nSign up / manage to our newsletters with a single click\nGet notified by email for early bird access to discounts & offers to our products\n✕\nLooks like you are already logged in from more than 3 devices!\nTo continue logging in, remove at least one device from the below list\nLog out\nLog Out from all devices\nTerms & conditions\n|\nInstitutional Subscriber\nComments\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

This ain’t love, it’s clear to see, But darling, stay with me,”\nthe iconic chorus of Sam Smith’s\n‘Stay With Me’\nthat resonated through the\n‘57th Grammy Awards\nperfectly mirrors\nRafael Nadal\n’s legendary connection with Roland Garros. Since his first triumph on the\nParisian clay\nin 2005, Rafa has cherished the court like no other, etching his name in the history books of tennis. And now, less than a year after stepping away from the sport, his love affair with the Court Philiipe-Chatrier appears destined for eternity. As a fitting tribute to the Spanish icon who reigned supreme for 20 years at Roland Garros, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) is preparing a monumental send-off to honor the true\nKing of Clay\n.\nBorn with a degenerative foot condition and plagued by chronic pain throughout his career, Rafa defied the odds to put his name among tennis immortals. With 92 ATP singles titles to his name, he conquered every Grand Slam tournament: twice at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, four times at the US Open, but his love affair with Parisian clay was truly unparalleled.\nFrom his unforgettable Roland Garros debut in 2005, when he said,\n“I played with my best shade, with my best tennis,\n”\nafter defeating Mariano Puerta in the final, to his 14th and final French Open triumph in 2022, Nadal cherished every inch of Court Philippe-Chatrier. His name and the clay courts of Roland Garros are forever intertwined: a sporting legacy like no other. Now, as whispers grow about a ‘grand tribute’ at the 2025 edition, the FFT seems poised to give Nadal the farewell he deserves, the final chapter in a love story that shaped tennis history.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn a recent talk show of\nStudio des légendes\n, Gilles Moretton, president of the FFT, revealed,\n“There will necessarily be something for Rafael Nadal, a real tribute, very important. We are attached to it. The [Davis Cup] tribute was not really the one that we had to pay him. We went to see him at home, at the beginning of December, with Amélie Mauresmo to talk to him about this tribute that we will organize for him, and talked to him about the future.”\n👏🇪🇸🇫🇷 President of the FFT Gilles Moretton says Rafael Nadal will receive a ‘special’ ceremony Roland Garros, and that Rafa may become an official ‘ambassador’ of the tournament:\n“There will necessarily be something for Rafael Nadal, a real tribute, very important. We are…\npic.twitter.com/EIKMwQJgrK\n— Olly Tennis 🎾🇬🇧 (@Olly_Tennis_)\nFebruary 21, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nHe continued,\n“We will give the outlines in some time of this role of ambassador that he can hold with us. The two ‘brands’, Rafael Nadal and Roland-Garros, are one. So yes, we are considering things with him,”.\nThe 22-time GS winner bid an emotional farewell to tennis at the 2024 Davis Cup in Málaga, as Spain fell 1-2 to the Netherlands in the final. But was it ever about the result? As he stood up for the Spanish national anthem for the last time as a pro player, Nadal fought back tears, his hands trembling at his side. The crowd erupted with chants of,\n“Rafa! Rafa!”\nmirroring his raw emotion.\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros the greatest in tennis history, or is there a close second?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nDespite nearly ‘two decades’ of dominance on the clay of Roland Garros, the former No.1’s final wave to the crowd after his loss to current World No. 2 Alexander Zverev remains etched in memory. Now, the highly anticipated 2025 collaboration promises to immortalize the clay courts as the true home of the 2008 Beijing Gold winner.\nYet, even in his absence from the new season, Rafa continues to captivate! Recently, he extended his heartfelt wishes to a fellow Spanish player, one he once shared the Parisian stage with: proving that his connection to the sport and its future stars remains as strong as ever.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\n“See you soon” — Rafael Nadal shares his best wishes to Fernando Verdasco\n17-3! An astonishing H2H record that Rafael Nadal holds against his compatriot\nFernando Verdasco\n, dating back to their first clash in Hamburg in 2003. The two Spaniards not only battled fiercely but also teamed up 8 times on the ATP Tour, even achieving the rare feat of breaking into the Top 10 of the doubles rankings.\nHowever, while Rafa bid an emotional farewell in 2024, Verdasco quietly ended his 24-year professional career at the Qatar Open, playing alongside none other than\nNovak Djokovic\n. And, honoring his longtime rival and teammate, the icon from Mallorca sent a heartfelt tribute to his fellow Madrid comrade, once again proving why he remains a true ambassador of the sport.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nJust after Verdasco’s retirement, Nadal wrote on social media,\n“We’ve experienced great battles on the court and very nice moments with Spain at the Davis Cup! Congratulations on your great career, @FerVerdasco!” Nadal wrote. “I hope you can now keep enjoying your family even more and your new challenges,\nsee you soon!\n”\nDespite already being immortalized by sculptor ‘Jordi Díez Fernández’s’ masterpiece unveiled in 2021, Rafa’s upcoming collaboration with the FFT is set to etch his legacy even deeper in tennis history. And of course, there’s one ultimate piece we can never forget to mention: ¡Vamos, Rafa!\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nIs Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros the greatest in tennis history, or is there a close second?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"

Prajwal Dev, on the other hand, earned his ATP ranking in 2015 and has competed in both singles and doubles throughout his career, winning one ATP Challenger doubles and several ITF doubles titles, including four in 2024.\nTournament Director Sunil Yajman commented on the occasion: “The Bengaluru Open has always played a key role in giving Indian players a platform to compete at a high level, and this year is no different.

I was not even thinking of making an official announcement or playing for one last time until I spoke with him [Djokovic]. Now I'm so happy to make it possible here in Doha. I've been living here for 10 years now, so this feels like my house, like my home, and there is no better way to retire in my home, with all my family, with my friends, and with someone like Novak Djokovic who, obviously, in the matter of numbers, is the best player in history of tennis and one of the best athletes in history as well,\" said Fernando Verdasco.\nAd\nFollowing this, Verdasco also revealed the biggest memory of his life, saying:\n\"The biggest [memory] is the Davis Cup for my country, which I won three times.

Djokovic may be the best of all time, but Federer is the greatest. He has no rival.\"\nDjokovic has won more Grand Slam titles than any other player in history, making him the statistical choice when it comes to picking the greatest player of all time.\nPersonal preference also comes into the debate at times, though, with Federer and\nRafael Nadal\nhaving millions of backers despite failing to win as many trophies as Djokovic.\nFonseca previously revealed that he idolised Federer while growing up, saying at the\nAustralian Open\n: \"My idol was always Roger.

It means I'm on the right track. It's gratifying to hear these comments from such important people in our sport.\"\nFonseca's next outing will be at Indian Wells, where he has received a wildcard into the main draw. It will mark his second time competing at an ATP Masters 1000 event, with his first appearance coming at last year's Madrid Open."

Melbourne Melbourne Park Victoria Australia, EDITORIAL USE ONLY\nPUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xMikexFreyx 20250114_lbm_zg6_660\n“\nIt was too much\n, I guess, to\nhandle for me\nat the moment,”\nNovak Djokovic\nsaid after his untimely withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury. Last month, his quest for a 25th Slam faced a major setback. In the SF round against Alexander Zverev, the 24-time Major champion and 10-time AO king was forced to pull himself out of the court because of persistent pain in his leg. Fortunately, it didn’t take him long to recover and resume on-court action with the Qatar Open. But guess what? The clouds of uncertainty on his 2025 season have resurfaced. Is Djokovic okay?\nReturning from injury earlier this week, Djokovic appeared in Doha for his third ATP event of this season. However, he lost his first-round battle against Italy’s Matteo Berrettini. The World No. 35 managed to pull off a huge upset, defeating the Serbian with a score line of 7-6 (4), 6-2. Despite this result, the positive news was that Djoker didn’t sustain any more injury on the court and showed no signs of pain… until Friday.\nOn X, a clip featuring Djokovic was shared, dated February 21. It showed him entering Doha’s Hamad International Airport. But the concerning part is that he was seen limping while making his way inside. Now that’s definitely not good news for his avid fans and any tennis lover. While the video only lasted for eight seconds, it was long enough to confirm Djokovic’s pain making its way back. What’s crucial to note is that this saddening update comes just days after his R32 loss against Berrettini.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nDjokovic limping as he leaves Doha.\nNot a good look…\npic.twitter.com/DRFUfOCH6L\n— José Morgado (@josemorgado)\nFebruary 21, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nAs of now, his next ATP event appearance will surely remain doubtful. But this season of Djokovic is, somehow, turning out as a mirror image of his previous season from 7 years ago. Remember how he struggled at the start of 2018 in a similar fashion?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhen Novak Djokovic suffered setbacks in an injury-riddled season\nEven in the 2018 season, an injury ended up becoming an unwanted companion of Novak Djokovic. He failed to start the year on a winning note down under and lost against South Korea’s Chung Hyeon. Then ranked 109, Hyeon stunned Djoker in a one-sided fourth-round battle. In straight sets, he beat the 10-time AO king with a score line of 7-6, 7-5, 7-6. After his exit from Melbourne, the Serbian suffered from an elbow injury. He went to Switzerland to have surgery. Due to the recovery break, he had to miss out on the Middle East swing. But when he came back on the court, it wasn’t pleasing enough.\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, in March 2018, Japan’s Taro Daniel handed him a shocking defeat. Daniel, who entered the event as a qualifier, gave Djokovic a tough time throughout the second-round encounter. Eventually, he ousted the Serbian with a final score line of 7-6(3), 4-6, 6-1. It was their first face-off and the Japanese ATP pro succeeded in emerging victorious.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Djokovic's injury-prone phase a sign of decline, or will he rise stronger in 2025?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nAfter his loss at the Indian Wells, Djokovic was left extremely upset. Not because of the result, but his pain!\n“I was not even supposed to be here because of the surgery that was only five, six weeks ago. But I recovered very quickly, and I got myself ready. That’s it. I mean, I played like everyone else,”\nhe said in a post-match official press conference in March 2018. However, he showed a positive intent back then, while saying\n, “I have experienced many times similar situations, so I know that there is always something good in it. You just need to try to set your mind at that frequency.”\nAt this point, too, Djokovic is suffering from a similar phase once again. Hopefully, he will bounce back in a strong way with a timely recovery. What are your thoughts on his prospects going forward in 2025?

However, his current existence is a stark contrast to his former life, with survival now his primary goal.\nThe Ukrainian, who peaked at number 13 in the\nATP rankings\nin 2012, and regularly faced off against the likes of Roger Federer and\nNovak Djokovic\n, even defeated\nRafael Nadal\nin 2014 and 2015. But when\nRussia\n, under Vladimir Putin's command, invaded\nUkraine\nin February 2022, Dolgopolov felt compelled to act.\nA self-proclaimed patriot, he didn't hesitate to swap his tennis racket for a firearm and head to the front lines. \"My conscience drove me [saying] 'you have to do it now',\" he said. \"But I had no idea about weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in Antalya.\"\nSpeaking to German publication\nDer Spiegel\n, Dolgopolov, who now serves as a drone pilot, shared insights into his daily life at war, reports\nthe Express\n. \"Basically, I am happy to be able to defend my country, but I want nothing more than peace,\" he said.\n\"I lack inner peace and a day without news of children, civilians, and comrades being killed.\" The 36-year-old also shared some of his harrowing experiences while fighting.\nInstagram\n\"In late summer 2023, my unit was in the Zaporizhia region,\" he said. \"We were filming the terrain with a drone when suddenly we were attacked. We jumped into a trench, but the impacts came closer and shook us violently.\n\"You have to understand that if grenades of this size fall less than eight metres from you, they can tear your insides apart. In the end, all we could do was hope it wouldn't happen to us. We were scared to death. After about 20 hits it stopped. It's crazy when I think about it in retrospect.\"\nFollowing the incident, Dolgopolov was hospitalised with a concussion for a week, yet he's now haunted daily by the spectre of mortality, confessing a fear greater than death itself. \"To be honest, I am more afraid of being injured and having to live life as a cripple. If I could choose, I would prefer to be dead,\" he said.\nWhile he's managed to avoid \"direct combat\", the death he has seen through his drone camera is scarring, and the ex-ATP Tour stalwart now simply yearns to survive the ordeal.\n\"Right now I just want to survive,\" he said. \"When a friend loses a leg right before your eyes, it gives you a new perspective on life. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.\"\nTop Stories\nDon't Miss\nFollow\nMirror\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nComment\nMORE ON\nDer Spiegel\nNovak Djokovic\nRafael Nadal\nRoger Federer\nVladimir Putin\nAustralian Open\nRussia Ukraine war\nTennis\nLeading new stories from around the globe\nSign up\nInvalid Email\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

Smith is one of the A-list celebrity owners—the most recent announcement was LeBron James—that the fledgling boat-racing circuit has been able to gather in its two years of racing.\nRelated Stories\nThe Fiat 124 Sport Spider’s Beautiful Lines and Feisty Engine Make It an Enduring Classic\nIt’s Official: Mercedes-Benz Is Making a Smaller G-Wagen\nThis James Bond-Inspired Land Rover Defender Is Now Heading to Auction\nThe nine-owner roster also includes Tom Brady,\nRafael Nadal\n, former soccer great Didier Drogba, singer Marc Anthony, DJ Steve Aoki and several others. Aoki’s two-member team took the season’s opening race in\nJeddah, Saudi Arabia\nlast month.\nThese A-List team owners are attempting to give E1 boat racing a mainstream following.\nSpaceship Media\nRodi Basso, the former business director for McLaren’s motorsport business, helped design the battery for the Formula E racecars. He came up with the  E1 electric boat-racing concept in 2020 and found financial backers a year later. In a relatively short period, he and the E1 series CEO, Alejandro Agag, who founded Formula E and Extreme E, had signed up Nadal, Anthony, and Aoki, and eventually the others became team owners.\n“We will cap the number of teams at 12 from the current nine,” Basso told\nRobb Report\n, following the opening race in Jeddah. “In five years, we plan to have those 12 teams in 15 races around the world.”\nJanuary’s races in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia attracted twice as many attendees as last year. The fledgling race circuit plans continued growth.\nSpacesuit Media\nThe raceboats are 23-foot, one-pilot, single-design foilers called\nRaceBirds\n, which have to race at the same spec. A male and female pilot swap places during different races of the series. The all-carbon-fiber boats weigh just 1,764 pounds.\nThey were designed by SeaBird Technologies and Victory Marine, and the propulsion came from Mercury Racing. The 150kW electric motor, powered by a 35 kWh battery, can push the foiler to 50 knots. But racing is not about maintaining this all-out speed along a straight line. The pilots have to manage the boat’s limited energy carefully around the circuits, while also adapting to race conditions.\nThe foiling e-boats can reach 50 knots in short bursts.\nSpacesuit Media\nTeam Brady won last year’s world championship, with stiff competition by Smith’s Team Westbrook and Anthony’s Team Miami, but several teams have swapped pilots for this season, so it’s not clear who will dominate 2025. “The teams were all within two or three seconds of each other in Jeddah, and between first and second, was only three tenths of a second,” says Basso. “The competition is very tight.”\nThe bigger question is whether the series will have the legs to continue into multiple seasons. Attendee numbers at the first race in Jeddah were nearly double that of last year—6,000 in 2024 compared to 10,000 last month. “We’re also seeing an increase in sponsorships,” says Basso. (Mainstream sponsors like Cox have signed on, but so have yacht builders like\nAzimut.\n) The series is about halfway to its $1 billion valuation target, says Basso. But the celebrity owners have had an uneven public presence. Not many are showing up to each race, at least en masse, to help draw the spectators. Smith will be the only owner in Doha.\nTeam Brazil’s Racebird.\nSpacesuit Media\nThe owners are all at the “peaks of their careers and are very good business people,” says Basso, and believe in the “potential” of E1 racing. “This offered the right ratio of cost and quality and let them be part of something purpose driven,” he says, adding that several have sold shares of their license at five times the initial evaluation. “They’re already capitalizing on this bet,” he says. “They are stakeholders and are keen to get the platform at 360 degrees to grow so they can benefit from it.”\nIt will also have potential technological benefits beyond boat racing, Basso says, noting a partnership with a tech company that manufactures battery cells for aerospace applications.\nTeam Brady in Venice last year. The former NFL star’s team won the first E1 World Championship.\nSpacesuit Media\nThe series last year featured A-list race venues like Venice, Monaco and Miami, with the same spots slotted for this year, as well an as-yet undisclosed venue in the Caribbean, another undisclosed stop in Europe, and the races in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which is attempting to position itself as a mainstream tourist destination.\nE1 is different than professional powerboat racing, says Basso, which retains at best a small niche following. The\nSailGP\nracing circuit, which has struggled financially since its inception five years ago, has developed a similar business model to E1, but on a much larger, more expensive scale.\nTeam Brazil racing in Doha.\nSpacesuit Media\nWith the limited appeal of boat racing, how does E1 plan to break into the mainstream? “We’re not only a sport but an expression of technology, so we’ll distinguish ourselves for the sustainability side of the racing,” he says. “We’re also lifestyle. That means a connection to the premium aspects of the hospitality sector, which makes us a bit different compared to the others.”\nMaybe. In the meantime, there’s the racing which is fun, exciting and quiet.\nHere’s\nwhere to watch it.\nRelated Stories\nThe Fiat 124 Sport Spider’s Beautiful Lines and Feisty Engine Make It an Enduring Classic\nIt’s Official: Mercedes-Benz Is Making a Smaller G-Wagen\nThis James Bond-Inspired Land Rover Defender Is Now Heading to Auction\nRead More On:\nE1\nElectric Boat Racing"

                "A darkness currently hangs over\nPep Guardiola\nand his Manchester City side, which shows little sign of moving. It was especially apparent this week in the brutal 3-1 defeat at the hands of Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid. City were completely outgunned and a mixture of inexperience and ageing players is the cause if you are to read too heavily into tabloid fodder. But if you believe in horological juju, a touchline\nwrist check\ncould have played a part – at least in this instance.\nThe City manager decided to rock his limited edition Richard Mille RM 27-01 Tourbillon Rafael Nadal with his now signature ribbed knit and C.P. Company cargos​​ – the legendary Spanish tennis player's name attached to it because he's a long-serving RM ambassador. The watch was released in 2018, and only 10 were made. Given these don’t come up for sale very often, the chances of seeing one in the wild are slim to none – unless of course you're a Manchester City fans and spot one on your gaffer's wrist.\nGuardiola is pretty well acquainted with Richard Mille, with ridiculous feats of horology like the million pound limited edition RM 61-01, RM 022\nTourbillon\nAerodyne, and RM 010 ‘\nManchester City\n’​​ in his collection. He also has more attainable pieces like an IWC Big Pilot’s watch, Rolex Sea-Dweller Deep-Sea, Chopard Mille Miglia GT XL Speed Black FC Barcelona Chronograph​​, while a special A. Lange & Söhne Datograph Perpetual Datograph Perpetual 410.038​​ sits at the top of his collection in the classy stakes.\nThe RM27-01 makes for a particularly mean wrist check – weighing 18.83 grams despite housing a manual wind tourbillon movement, thanks to some grade five titanium used for the baseplate and tourbillon carriage. But given Nadal's association with this ticker, might it be plausible to say it could have been a bad omen?\nInstagram content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it\noriginates\nfrom.\nNadal is a fierce\nReal Madrid\nfan, (he was in the stands for a 2024 Champions League match against Liverpool), so was likely gassed when Real Madrid won. And if you really deep it, Guardiola's choice of watch was an oversight – especially for football's conspiracy theorist, of which there are too many.  Football aside, Nadal has been behind some pretty incredible\nRichard Mille\nreleases, like the mega rare 2018 RM27-01 and RM 27-05 Manual Winding Flying Tourbillon in 2019. Basically, Nadal likes a tourbillon and so does Guardiola.\nThe tourbillon was invented to counter inaccuracies in pocket watches caused by gravity, packing in more than 70 parts into a wrist-sized ticker. It’s a bit hypnotic, looks really good, and performs reliably well – kinda like Real Madrid on Wednesday.\nManchester City\non the other hand, are less predictable with uncharacteristic defeats plaguing Guardiola\net al\nall season.\nGranted, Pep Guardiola’s one-of-ten Richard Mille RM27-01 Tourbillon​​ is an ultra rare kettle that most of us will only ever read about, or see momentarily on Instagram. But on second thoughts, a ride-out for a Champions League game against Real Madrid might not have been the best time to wear it."

However, his current existence is a stark contrast to his former life, with survival now his primary goal.\nThe Ukrainian, who peaked at number 13 in the\nATP rankings\nin 2012, and regularly faced off against the likes of Roger Federer and\nNovak Djokovic\n, even defeated\nRafael Nadal\nin 2014 and 2015. But when\nRussia\n, under Vladimir Putin's command, invaded\nUkraine\nin February 2022, Dolgopolov felt compelled to act.\nA self-proclaimed patriot, he didn't hesitate to swap his tennis racket for a firearm and head to the front lines. \"My conscience drove me [saying] 'you have to do it now',\" he said. \"But I had no idea about weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in Antalya.\"\nSpeaking to German publication\nDer Spiegel\n, Dolgopolov, who now serves as a drone pilot, shared insights into his daily life at war, reports\nthe Express\n. \"Basically, I am happy to be able to defend my country, but I want nothing more than peace,\" he said.\n\"I lack inner peace and a day without news of children, civilians, and comrades being killed.\" The 36-year-old also shared some of his harrowing experiences while fighting.\nInstagram\n\"In late summer 2023, my unit was in the Zaporizhia region,\" he said. \"We were filming the terrain with a drone when suddenly we were attacked. We jumped into a trench, but the impacts came closer and shook us violently.\n\"You have to understand that if grenades of this size fall less than eight metres from you, they can tear your insides apart. In the end, all we could do was hope it wouldn't happen to us. We were scared to death. After about 20 hits it stopped. It's crazy when I think about it in retrospect.\"\nFollowing the incident, Dolgopolov was hospitalised with a concussion for a week, yet he's now haunted daily by the spectre of mortality, confessing a fear greater than death itself. \"To be honest, I am more afraid of being injured and having to live life as a cripple. If I could choose, I would prefer to be dead,\" he said.\nWhile he's managed to avoid \"direct combat\", the death he has seen through his drone camera is scarring, and the ex-ATP Tour stalwart now simply yearns to survive the ordeal.\n\"Right now I just want to survive,\" he said. \"When a friend loses a leg right before your eyes, it gives you a new perspective on life.

Following his impressive victory over Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open finals, Zverev couldn’t help but draw a parallel to Novak Djokovic, saying,\n“He’s very, very similar to Novak when he was at his best.”\nThat’s some high praise for the young Italian! But the accolades don’t end there. WTA legend Chris Evert chimed in, noting Sinner’s maturity and poise on the court, comparing him to both Roger Federer and\nRafael Nadal\nduring their early days. However, after testing positive for clostebol in March 2024, he faced scrutiny despite being cleared once by the ITIA in August. Now, with WADA imposing a three-month ban, former ATP pro-Georges Goven is set to weigh in on the situation as discussions about fairness and support for Sinner continue to unfold.\nWhat began in March 2024 has taken quite a wild turn for World No. 1 on his journey to greatness. He first tested positive for the banned substance during his at the BNP Paribas Open. Later the ITIA cleared him on grounds of\n“no fault or negligence”\nin August, only for WADA to come in and resurface the case to be appealed before CAS which was initially announced to be held in April, however, as per WADA’s General Counsel, Ross Wenzel, who noted that the agency is\n“blind to the calendar.”\nAnd that many tests were conducted\n“12 months preceding the two positives of March”\nto explain why Sinner’s case was resolved the way it was.\nHowever, that doesn’t seem to appease the players like Nick Krygios, and Novak Djokovic or the fans who have noted that the system displayed impartial treatment and\n“favoritism\n” in the light of Sinner’s case. To add to that narrative, the former 56th player in the world, Georges Goven added his take by drawing a comparison to the Italian with that of the Spanish GOAT Rafael Nadal.\nHe said\n,\n“Rafael Nadal has been tested more than 400 times in his life, he has never had anything. There, there were two positive tests, that’s the difference.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nvia Getty\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK – AUGUST 23: Jannik Sinner of Italy speaks to the media during a press conference ahead of the 2024 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on August 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\nWhile analysts have compared Sinner’s playing style and attitude on the court, they are most likely reserved to Novak and Federer. Albeit, a former Italian player Corrado Barazzutti once noted that\n“He plays at the level of a young Djokovic, a young Nadal, a young Federer.”\nBut with his doping ban, it seems like his legacy is about to be tainted unlike that of the three legends who have never tested positive during the course of their careers.\nThis was emphasized by Goven but was straightforward in his admission,\n“We all agree that Sinner is a good person, interesting, calm, charismatic even if his game is not always very spectacular. But there will always be the fact that he tested positive twice, which has never happened to Nadal.”\nWhile that may be true, it doesn’t mean that the Spaniard didn’t face his share of controversies in his time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn 2012, Nadal faced allegations from former French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot, who suggested that his seven-month injury break was due to a failed drug test. To defend his reputation, Nadal filed a defamation suit against Bachelot and emerged victorious, resulting in her being fined €500 (approximately $524.03) and ordered to pay him €12,000 (about $12,480.60) in damages and legal fees. Nadal graciously donated the compensation to charity, emphasizing his commitment to clean sport and the values he upholds throughout his career. Moreover, when Jannik’s case surfaced, Rafa showed his support to the Italian.\nRafael Nadal showed his support for Jannik during doping controversy\nIn September, Rafa expressed his support for Sinner in an interview with El Hormiguero, stating,\n“I trust that if he has not been sanctioned it is because those who have had to judge this case have clearly seen that what happened was not punishable.”\nHe emphasized that opinions vary but stood firmly behind the regulatory bodies’ decision.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nCan Jannik Sinner's talent overshadow the doping controversy, or will it forever taint his legacy?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nThe ITIA investigated and held a hearing in August, ultimately accepting Sinner’s explanation that the banned substance entered his system unintentionally. Sinner revealed that his physiotherapist had used a spray containing the substance during a massage, leading to the accidental doping violation. The ITIA concluded that Sinner did not intentionally violate any doping regulations and decided against imposing a period of ineligibility. However, despite being cleared initially, Sinner recently accepted a three-month ban from February 9 to May 4, 2025, following a settlement with WADA.\nAs the conversation surrounding Sinner’s case continues to ignite on social media, he faces the music ahead of his return just in time for the 2025 French Open.

Following her victory at the 2024 French Open, she encountered setbacks, including a positive test for the banned substance TMZ in August, which sidelined her during the Asian Swing and cost her the top ranking to Aryna Sabalenka. Additionally, Swiatek parted ways with her longtime coach Tomasz Wiktorowski and began working with Wim Fissette in December. However, the 2025 season has presented a new set of challenges, testing her resolve and pushing her patience to its limits.\nTo sum it up, Swiatek has yet to win a title since May 2024. While she’s made strides to reach the semifinals at the Australian Open and Qatar Open this year, her losses to lower-ranked opponents like\nMadison Keys\nand Jelena Ostapenko have raised concerns. However, the Pole looked dominant in her opening two matches at the Dubai Tennis Championships, dropping just seven games on her way to the quarter-finals. Unfortunately, her latest match ended disappointingly as the 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva took her down in two sets.\nAndreeva made history as the youngest player ever to reach the semifinals of the tournament. After being down 3-1 in the second set, she turned the tide and rattled off five games in a row to defeat a five-time Grand Slam champion, in just one hour and 36 minutes! This was undoubtedly a tough pill for Swiatek to swallow, as she appeared visibly frustrated after the match.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nOutside the arena, a fan on X shared a video of Swiatek leaving while her coach Fissette offered her a supportive handshake, which she ignored as she rushed past him. This moment caught the attention of many fans on social media. Considering Fissette’s support after her abrupt split with former coach Wiktorowski, it seemed a bit disrespectful. Fans are still trying to understand why Wiktorowski left so suddenly mid-season last year.\n👀\npic.twitter.com/uHwt3e2Q3Y\n— Madziol (@madziol127)\nFebruary 20, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nAdditionally, Swiatek’s current reputation in the community hasn’t been the kindest, perhaps due to her own actions. During the Australian Open against Keys, she engaged in distracting antics by practicing shots while Keys was preparing to serve. This behavior didn’t sit well with fans.\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Iga Swiatek's behavior on court a sign of passion or just poor sportsmanship?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nFans unhappy with Iga Swiatek’s rejection of Fissette’s handshake\nAfter Swiatek’s recent defeat to Mirra Andreeva in the Dubai Tennis Championships, fans have been vocal about her reaction. One observer noted,\n“Nie miała ochoty na przybijanie piątek po porażce,”\nwhich translates to\n“She wasn’t in the mood for high-fives after defeat.”\nIt’s no surprise that Iga doesn’t take losing lightly—nobody does, especially when you’ve held the No. 1 position and clinched major titles over the past three years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAs another fan put it,\n“[Translated from Polish] Scandal. One smashes and throws missiles, another reacts differently. Iga doesn’t like losing, so she’s furious and that’s it.”\nThe world No. 14 fell 1-3 down in the second set but reeled off five straight games to seal her first win against Swiatek, breaking Iga’s streak of reaching the semifinals and possibly winning her first event of the season.\nOne user tweeted,\n“@iga_swiatek that is not nice. You are taking things too personal. If you keep doing this it’s gonna keep spiraling into more loses. Show some respect.”\nThis seems to be a recurring theme from fans toward the Pole. During the Australian Open match against Madison Keys, Swiatek confused onlookers with her practice swings mid-match, leading fans to call her antics\n“dirty tactics.”\nAnother comment stated,\n“[Translated from Polish] At the age of 24, such spoiled behavior could backfire on her.”\nAdding a bit of humor to the situation, someone remarked,\n“It’s important that he has a psychologist in his team 🤡.”\nIn the past year, she has been quite vocal about having a psychologist on her team, Daria Abramowicz, whom she credits for helping her manage both on-court stress and personal challenges. This underscores the seriousness of mental resilience in sports today.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nLastly, one fan bluntly expressed their feelings writing,\n“sore loser like Nadal,”\ncomparing her to her idol\nRafael Nadal\n, who is known for his intense passion on the court and often displays frustration when things don’t go his way. Similarly, Swiatek has shown signs of anger and disappointment after losses, particularly in high-stakes matches. The fan draws a parallel between the two since Iga looks up to Nadal and has said,\n“Overall, I’m his fan more because of how he behaves. This is something that I try to look up to more,”\nas per the WTA website.\nAs she continues to adapt to new coaching dynamics and navigate the pressures of competition, fans and analysts alike are left wondering: can Iga Swiatek rise again?\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nIs Iga Swiatek's behavior on court a sign of passion or just poor sportsmanship?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"

                "Former No13 tennis star on front line of war witnessing deaths and ‘just trying to survive’\nFormer tennis star Aleksandr Dolgopolov has been on the front lines of the war in Ukraine, and he has opened up on the trauma he has experienced during the conflict\nAlexandr Dolgopolov has opened up on his life on the front lines of the war\n(\nImage: Getty)\nBy\nChris Burns\nSenior Sports Writer - Under 35s\nMaria Ortega\n13:47, 21 Feb 2025\n|\ncomments\nFormer\ntennis\nstar Aleksandr Dolgopolov has revealed the grim reality of the front lines since joining the Ukrainian army in response to Russia's full-scale\ninvasion\n.\nOnce a regular on the\nGrand Slam\ncircuit, Dolgopolov even reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in 2011 before retiring in 2021 after a commendable career. However, his current existence is a stark contrast to his former life, with survival now his primary goal.\nThe Ukrainian, who peaked at number 13 in the\nATP rankings\nin 2012, and regularly faced off against the likes of Roger Federer and\nNovak Djokovic\n, even defeated\nRafael Nadal\nin 2014 and 2015. But when\nRussia\n, under Vladimir Putin's command, invaded\nUkraine\nin February 2022, Dolgopolov felt compelled to act.\nA self-proclaimed patriot, he didn't hesitate to swap his tennis racket for a firearm and head to the front lines. \"My conscience drove me [saying] 'you have to do it now',\" he said. \"But I had no idea about weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in Antalya.\"\nSpeaking to German publication\nDer Spiegel\n, Dolgopolov, who now serves as a drone pilot, shared insights into his daily life at war, reports\nthe Express\n. \"Basically, I am happy to be able to defend my country, but I want nothing more than peace,\" he said.\n\"I lack inner peace and a day without news of children, civilians, and comrades being killed.\" The 36-year-old also shared some of his harrowing experiences while fighting.\nInstagram\n\"In late summer 2023, my unit was in the Zaporizhia region,\" he said. \"We were filming the terrain with a drone when suddenly we were attacked. We jumped into a trench, but the impacts came closer and shook us violently.\n\"You have to understand that if grenades of this size fall less than eight metres from you, they can tear your insides apart. In the end, all we could do was hope it wouldn't happen to us. We were scared to death. After about 20 hits it stopped. It's crazy when I think about it in retrospect.\"\nFollowing the incident, Dolgopolov was hospitalised with a concussion for a week, yet he's now haunted daily by the spectre of mortality, confessing a fear greater than death itself. \"To be honest, I am more afraid of being injured and having to live life as a cripple. If I could choose, I would prefer to be dead,\" he said.\nWhile he's managed to avoid \"direct combat\", the death he has seen through his drone camera is scarring, and the ex-ATP Tour stalwart now simply yearns to survive the ordeal.\n\"Right now I just want to survive,\" he said. \"When a friend loses a leg right before your eyes, it gives you a new perspective on life. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.\"\nTop Stories\nDon't Miss\nFollow\nMirror\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nComment\nMORE ON\nDer Spiegel\nNovak Djokovic\nRafael Nadal\nRoger Federer\nVladimir Putin\nAustralian Open\nRussia Ukraine war\nTennis\nLeading new stories from around the globe\nSign up\nInvalid Email\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

                "Yes, Lindsey Vonn understands the landscape. Tom Brady. Simone Biles. Novak Djokovic. âAnd LeBron,â she says in early January, shortly after\nher unprecedented comeback\nat age 40, âis only a few months younger than I am, and heâs still breaking records every game he plays, pretty much, soââ¦â\nYes, Lindsey Vonn heard from all of you. That sheâs âgone completely mad,â as one retired skier so sensitively put it. That sheâs craving attention. That she should have stayed retired.\nLast summer Vonn went to Paris, where\nBiles, 27, was the oldest U.S. gymnast to compete at the Olympics\nsince 1952. Vonn watched Biles, she says, âfar exceed what everyone believed to be the limits of a gymnastâs physical ability to performâ in her third Games.\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\nSports Illustrated: They called Simone âgrandma.â\nLindsey Vonn:\nNobodyâs said that to me yet. Or at least not to my face.\nSI:\nBrady told me 10 years ago that older, elite athletes are examined with old paradigms. Do you agree?Â\nLV:\nTotally. You canât compare athletes now to even 10 years ago, because of whatâs available. Thereâs so much more we understand and know about the body and performance.\nAge is not an indication these days of whether an athlete can be successful or not. The biggest question is, do they have the skill? Do they have the knowledge? Brady was the smartest quarterback in history. That knowledge has value. And, in ski racing, itâs similar.\nI have been racing for a lot longer than a lot of [my competitors] have been alive. I have a lot more knowledge. And that is meaningful. I have the ability to put those things together and do exactly what Tom did.\nSI: \tBeautiful answer, if only because your interviewer put on Biofreeze before a Zoom call this morning.\nLV:\nAmazing. You smell great.\nVonn never planned this comeback. It just sort of happened. The basics: Injuries accumulated until she could no longer compete; she worked on her body, stayed in shape and had access to all sorts of elite doctors. Had conversations with them. Listened to them. Then met one who was different than the others, and that changed the only opinion that matteredâhers.\nSI: \tPatience seems critical here. Not the first\nthing Iâd associate with ski racing, but itâs necessary, no?\nLV:\nWe are the epitome of an outside, outdoor sport. You have to be patient with the weather, the schedule; itâs a game of hurry up and wait. You have to be patient right up until that moment, which requires aggression, balance, calmness and a strong mind\n.\nTo understand how the impossible became quite possible, allow Vonn to explain:\nâI dream big. Iâve always dreamed big. Iâve been about the Olympics since I met Picabo Street when I was 9. I have lots of dreams, and Iâm still dreaming pretty high. That part of me hasnât changed, and I donât think it ever will, so you can imagine what Iâm thinking aboutââ¦â\nSI:\nYou seemââ¦âfree now. Fair?\nLV:\nI mean, sometimes peopleâs perception of me changed. My perception of myself never has. Iâm still the same little girl who wanted to be a ski racer and wanted to be an Olympian. Maybe now, Iâm just a little bit more myself; I donât have the expectations or outside pressure I might have felt more before. People see this in my face. Iâm having such a great time. Iâm laughing. Iâm smiling. And some of that is a weight thatâs been lifted off of me.\nI feel like a kid, and that may sound weird coming from a 40-year-old. But, sometimes, you just never grow up. Maybe that means Iâm naÃ¯ve. But I still dream.\nVonn won her first Olympic medal in 2010 at the Vancouver Olympics.  | Simon Bruty /Sports Illustrated\nVonn retired\nonly when her dreams felt unreachable, her body broken, ligaments torn, in daily pain. She left competitive ski racing in 2019 after 15 seasons with 82 World Cup wins, at the time the most ever for a female competitorâa mark since broken by\nMikaela Shiffrin\n, who has 99. And second-most ever, behind the pre-Shiffrin gold standard, 86 victories by Ingemar Stenmark. Vonn also claimed three Olympic medals, 20 World Cup titles (including four Crystal Globes for overall performance), eight world championship medals and 137 World Cup podiums. But she also tore her ACL and MCL in her right knee in a 2013 crash. And then reinjured that same ACL later that year. In â18, she tore her LCL in her left knee and had multiple fractures in that same leg during a training crash. And thatâs not counting another knee fracture, ankle fracture and severe arm fracture in between those tears.\nLV:\nMy injuries held me back.\nI didnât miss it. I was in so much pain the last few years of my career, that it was time; I was at peace with being finished. I didnât have any regrets about it. But, of course, I missed going fast.\nShe dove into retirement by taking off the bubble wrap elite skiers must don to survive a dangerous sport. She windsurfed and surfed wakes. She tried polo, but that didnât work out. She injured her back after a bad fall from one horse, got healthy and climbed right back on. She took adventures, traveled the world. And she skied recreationally, traveling to slopes she had never raced on, taking leisurely runs, not knowing what she might do on a particular afternoon. She entertained tons of business opportunities and continued her work empowering and supporting underserved young women in competitive skiing. She also helped bring the\nWinter Games to Salt Lake City in 2034\n.\nLV:\nJust being as injured as I have been, I have had to wise up and figure out what my body can and canât do, what my injuries mean, what it looks like, what it feels like. I have to understand my anatomy better than anyone else, and thatâs been the case since my first ACL tear [in 2013] because I had problems I didnât quite understand until later.\nShe leaned on specialists and other doctors they recommended. Dr. Tom Hackett, a complex knee and shoulder surgeon based in Colorado, recommended Dr. Martin Roche, perhaps the foremost international expert on robotic and sensor-assisted surgery who is based in Florida.\nLV:\nDoctors have different opinions. It was important for me to research and take them all in. My body, technically, if you read an MRI, says I need a full knee replacement. Because itâs done.\nEvery doctor Vonn saw recommended a total knee replacement. Except one: Roche.\nLV:\nHe had a different perspective, and he was very smart about it. Because of him, we found I had a cyst in my bone from one of my ACL surgeries, and I couldnât even get the replacements because I needed to clean out the cyst and refill, repack the bone.\nVonn also spoke with others who had undergone this specific surgery. Like Chris Davenport, an extreme skier who saw Roche and now skis nearly half the year. Hackett performed the cyst cleanup for Vonn in July 2023. Roche did the partial replacementâwhatâs known as robot-assisted replacementâby cutting off three millimeters of bone and replacing that with two titanium pieces.\nLV:\nI had only hoped to live life pain free. [The procedure] changed my life entirely. I used to think about my knee pretty much every second of every day. Wake up sore, swollen. I would go on a hike with my friend and her 7-year-old and Aunt Lindsey would need a break after 10 minutes. It was really hard. And I thought, when I retired, giving my body a break would take away a lot of pain. And it didnât.\nVonn (far right) stayed active during her retirement and was part of the winning bid to bring the Olympics back to Salt Lake City in 2034. | Arturo Holmes/Getty Images\nOne month after the second surgery, Vonn could straighten that troublesome right leg. Once back in the gym, she tried exercises she had long ago shelvedâtoo painfulâand sometimes her body felt like it was eight years younger; other times, even younger than that. Once back on the slopes, she was knocking out nine training runs at first, then 15 in a single day; she hadnât done that since her mid-20s.\nShe knew she wanted to come back, regardless of history, after that very first training run.\nLV:\nEverything felt so different. When I got the surgery, I just felt so good. No more pain. All the things that had been bothering me for so many years were suddenly gone.\nComeback became her mission. At the highest levels of her sport, too. Finally able to train without her knee swelling, she could dream again.\nVonn enrolled in the drug testing program for World Cup competitors last September, and was promptly tested the next dayâand âquite frequentlyâ since. She shifted back into her old life as quietly as possible. But not quietly enough. News spread slowly, informally at first, within the insular world sheâd left behind. She was coming backâas the Bionic Woman.\nLV:\nI do feel bionic. I was saying that even before my knee replacement, because I have a plate and 18 screws in my arm, which gives me a pretty good volleyball serve. Iâve been put together more times than Iâd care to count or admit. If titanium will heal me, Iâll be the Terminator, any time.\nAhead of her 40th birthday in October, Vonn canceled a trip to a tropical destination that she had planned roughly six months earlier. Instead, she found herself training in Austria.\nLV:\nI didnât expect to be there. I needed to do something special for my 40th. We went to this cute hotel on Lake Como, had a nice dinner, a little cake, and thatâs it.\nVonnâs thinking had changed after the partial replacement. Sure, she needed to adjust to new equipment and ramp back, slowly, toward her own standard. She completed the required doping tests. Reentered World Cup qualifying. Rejoined the U.S. team, mentoring skiers whose median age is 26. Took part in lower-level competitions at Copper Mountain in Colorado. Qualified with a wild card. Served as the forerunnerâskiing ahead of the field to test the course and timing systemâin nearby Beaver Creek. Earned enough points to compete on the World Cup circuit. Flew to Switzerland in December.\nCompeted in her first World Cup race\nsince failing to finish a Super-G race in January 2019 in Italy. Had butterflies before competingâfirst time, long time. Raced, first, at about 85%. Upped that to 90% for her second spin down a mountain, at full speed.Â\nLV:\nIâve trained with top-30, top-20, even top-10 [competitors] for the last few weeks. Some days, Iâm winning training. Some days, Iâm testing out equipment. Thereâs some rust to shake off. But I havenât really lost anything. I feel like Iâm right where I left off, and Iâm actually healthier now than I was for the last few years.\nAs the oldest woman to compete in a World Cup race, Vonn says she feels stronger now than she did 10 years ago.  | John Locher/AP\nIn terms of acclimation, that famous\nAnchorman\nquote applies: âBoy, that escalated quickly!â Vonn stuck around Europe, continued training and competed again in January in St. Anton, Austria. In two more world-class competitions, without a full ramp-up, and less than a year since her last operation, she placed sixth (downhill) and fourth (Super-G), just missing the podium.\nLV:\nIâm skiing without thinking about my knee, which I havenât done since 2013. Iâm stronger than I was. Itâs better than nonexistent cartilage.\nThose St. Anton races are her highest finishes so far this season, having been unable to finish in both a Super-G and downhill race in a single competition since (she most recently placed 15th at the World Championships in downhill, but DNF in Super G). Should Vonn return to even near her peak form, she would become the oldest woman to win a World Cup race (Federica Brignone of Italy placed first in October and again at St. Anton, both times at age 34). On the menâs side, Johan Clarey of France won silver in the downhill at the 2022 Beijing Olympics at age 41 and made a World Cup podium at KitzbÃ¼hel at 42. So far, no one who covers or documents the sport can find another example of a woman racing at age 40 or older. NBC Sports reported that Vonn was the first woman in her 40s to score World Cup standings points, which she did every time she finished in the top 30.\nLV:\nI have to be patient. I know what Iâm capable of. Iâm really close.\nThe prize: compete in the Winter Olympics in Cortina dâAmpezzo, Italy, next February. Vonn has won three Olympic medals, including downhill gold in the\n2010 Vancouver Games\n. First, though, she wants to finish this season, finally take that tropical vacation, and then begin preparations for next season.\nLV:\nWould I have come back if Cortina werenât there? I donât know. That was one thing that really bothered me when I retired. I wanted to race in Cortina. That was a big goal and dream of mine.\nCompeting in Cortina would mark her fifth Olympic Games. She already holds the record for most World Cup wins there, with six in downhill and six in Super-G. She recorded her first podium finish there (2004), notched her first World Cup title there (downhill, â08) broke the all-time wins record there (â15) and broke the all-time downhill wins record there (â16).\nLV:\nI have a different connection with every mountain, if that makes sense. I understood Cortina very well. I knew the line I needed to take. Knew where the fall line was. Knew how to ski. It was a meaningful place for me, to begin with. Would be a great place toââ¦âclose the loop.\nShould that happen, with Vonn officially ending her career (this time for good) at the place where she has accomplished so much, perhaps there could be a Lindsey Vonn surgery, like the Tommy John procedure in baseball.\nLV:\nI donât know if youâll see that in sports. Because I feel like most people, when their knee gets that bad, they would quit anyway. Itâs a good option for many, many, many athletes who are retiring or have already retired.\nWe all view knee replacement as a scary thing that happens when you get old and canât walk anymore. But youâre able to bounce back faster and recover easier.\nShe still confronts hundreds of outdated takes. She wants her comeback to inspire paradigm change, too.\nLV:\nAs athletes, we adapt and we figure out how to manage pain. But there comes a point when you donât have to live that way anymore. We have technology to fix things that we thought were unfixable. That perspective, of competing at older ages, needs to change.\nSI:\nSome of the reaction to your comeback is wild.\nLV:\nBeen a little frustrating, because thatâs a close-minded way to think. This is 2025âa lot of things have changed. The conversation is not in the same universe as it was 25 years ago. I donât put any weight behind those comments [from competitors who retired a long time ago], and I actually feel sorry for them. They would have benefited from these procedures. I do hope this opens peopleâs eyes to whatâs possible. I already have skiers calling me, asking about their knees, hips.\nVonnâs mother, Lindy Krohn Lund, died in 2022, one year after having been diagnosed with ALS. Lund suffered a stroke while giving birth to Lindsey, which partially paralyzed her left leg. Vonn watched her mother struggle and fight for the remainder of her life.\nShe begins to cry, softly at first, then a little louder.\nLV:\nNo, itâs a beautiful thing. I think about it every day.\n(Brief pause.)\nSome idiot online said, âI hope Lindsey has a lot of guardian angels, because what sheâs doing is crazy.â And, unfortunately, I do. Sheâd be proud of me. I reread her journals when she passed, and every time I had a race, she was up at 3 a.m. watching, and in her journal, she would write the date, the time, the place I got.\nI actually feel very protected, in a weird way, because I know sheâs looking out for me, and that gives me strength.\nÂ\nPublished\n23 hours ago\n| Modified\n14 hours ago\nGREG BISHOP\nGreg Bishop is a senior writer for Sports Illustrated who has covered every kind of sport and every major event across six continents for more than two decades.

To reach that stage, there’s much to prove, especially when we’re talking about the Swiss luxury watchmaker Rolex. The top-tier label houses some of the greats like\nRoger Federer\nas its brand ambassadors. It’s not every day they find players who reflect their shared value of precision but, even the high-demanded watchmaker couldn’t deny the inclusion of A-list stars,\nJannik Sinner\nand\nCoco Gauff\n, who have stunned the sport with their athletic finesse.\nThe latest updates show us that Rolex revealed American No. 1 Gauff and Italian trailblazer Sinner as the latest faces of their 2025 ambassadorship program. Though the duo is already endorsed by Rolex, Sinner, and Gauff have now featured alongside Federer for the first time. A new teaser released on the brand’s official Instagram handle showcased both players in a clip with Federer for the Swiss watchmaker’s 2025 catalog edition.\nUndoubtedly a classy move to give Federer some company, seeing as the 20-time Slam winner has been associated with the $10.7 billion company since 2001. Moreover, Rolex also teased the launch date of their highly anticipated celebrity line-up for the season by captioning their post –\n“25 February 2025.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by ROLEX (@rolex)\nAs for the Gauff and Sinner’s 2025 season, the American sensation’s campaign has been a mixed bag so far. She started the season strong at the Australian Open and finished as a quarterfinalist. However, the World No. 3 couldn’t find her footing in the Middle East swing. She lost both her opening round contests in Doha and Dubai. Meanwhile, Sinner made way for triumphant results this season, until bitter-sweet news plagued his chances to continue.\nThe Italian star successfully defended his Australian Open title in January and days later, was awarded a three-month suspension from competitive tennis. Sinner later gathered a few words to sum up the conclusion of his controversial doping nightmare – one that has been the sport’s hottest topic since 2024.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nJannik Sinner accepts responsibility for doping saga following the three-month ban\nItalian superstar Jannik Sinner twice tested positive for the banned anabolic clostebol in March last year. The International Tennis Integrity Agency accepted his defense plea and awarded him with a\n“no guilt or negligence”\nverdict, allowing him to participate and lift several high-end ATP titles – the US Open, ATP Finals, and the Australian Open. However, it wasn’t long before the World Anti-Doping Agency stepped in and appealed against the decision.\nWADA filed for a decision reversal with the Court of Arbitration (CAS), seeking a ban of 1-2 years on Sinner. The final hearing of his case was set for April. However, World No. 1 reached a case resolution agreement with WADA on Saturday, February 15, and settled to serve a three-month doping hiatus from the tour. His suspension immediately raised flags, seeing as the stipulated period wouldn’t sideline him from Slam events, prompting players like\nNick Kyrgios\nand\nNovak Djokovic\nto lament the irregularities in the decision-making process.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nRolex's choice: Is Sinner's doping saga overshadowing his talent, or is he still a worthy ambassador?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nHowever, Sinner later addressed his thoughts on the matter and highlighted that he was relieved to get an opportunity to put the past behind him. The 23-year-old said, “\nThis case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year.”\n“I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA’s offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction,”\nhe added. The 23-year-old will be eligible to return to competition on May 4. Sinner will likely make the most of his suspension to prepare ahead of the French Open.\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nRolex's choice: Is Sinner's doping saga overshadowing his talent, or is he still a worthy ambassador?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"

Following his impressive victory over Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open finals, Zverev couldn’t help but draw a parallel to Novak Djokovic, saying,\n“He’s very, very similar to Novak when he was at his best.”\nThat’s some high praise for the young Italian! But the accolades don’t end there. WTA legend Chris Evert chimed in, noting Sinner’s maturity and poise on the court, comparing him to both Roger Federer and\nRafael Nadal\nduring their early days. However, after testing positive for clostebol in March 2024, he faced scrutiny despite being cleared once by the ITIA in August. Now, with WADA imposing a three-month ban, former ATP pro-Georges Goven is set to weigh in on the situation as discussions about fairness and support for Sinner continue to unfold.\nWhat began in March 2024 has taken quite a wild turn for World No. 1 on his journey to greatness. He first tested positive for the banned substance during his at the BNP Paribas Open. Later the ITIA cleared him on grounds of\n“no fault or negligence”\nin August, only for WADA to come in and resurface the case to be appealed before CAS which was initially announced to be held in April, however, as per WADA’s General Counsel, Ross Wenzel, who noted that the agency is\n“blind to the calendar.”\nAnd that many tests were conducted\n“12 months preceding the two positives of March”\nto explain why Sinner’s case was resolved the way it was.\nHowever, that doesn’t seem to appease the players like Nick Krygios, and Novak Djokovic or the fans who have noted that the system displayed impartial treatment and\n“favoritism\n” in the light of Sinner’s case. To add to that narrative, the former 56th player in the world, Georges Goven added his take by drawing a comparison to the Italian with that of the Spanish GOAT Rafael Nadal.\nHe said\n,\n“Rafael Nadal has been tested more than 400 times in his life, he has never had anything. There, there were two positive tests, that’s the difference.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nvia Getty\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK – AUGUST 23: Jannik Sinner of Italy speaks to the media during a press conference ahead of the 2024 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on August 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\nWhile analysts have compared Sinner’s playing style and attitude on the court, they are most likely reserved to Novak and Federer. Albeit, a former Italian player Corrado Barazzutti once noted that\n“He plays at the level of a young Djokovic, a young Nadal, a young Federer.”\nBut with his doping ban, it seems like his legacy is about to be tainted unlike that of the three legends who have never tested positive during the course of their careers.\nThis was emphasized by Goven but was straightforward in his admission,\n“We all agree that Sinner is a good person, interesting, calm, charismatic even if his game is not always very spectacular. But there will always be the fact that he tested positive twice, which has never happened to Nadal.”\nWhile that may be true, it doesn’t mean that the Spaniard didn’t face his share of controversies in his time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn 2012, Nadal faced allegations from former French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot, who suggested that his seven-month injury break was due to a failed drug test. To defend his reputation, Nadal filed a defamation suit against Bachelot and emerged victorious, resulting in her being fined €500 (approximately $524.03) and ordered to pay him €12,000 (about $12,480.60) in damages and legal fees. Nadal graciously donated the compensation to charity, emphasizing his commitment to clean sport and the values he upholds throughout his career. Moreover, when Jannik’s case surfaced, Rafa showed his support to the Italian.\nRafael Nadal showed his support for Jannik during doping controversy\nIn September, Rafa expressed his support for Sinner in an interview with El Hormiguero, stating,\n“I trust that if he has not been sanctioned it is because those who have had to judge this case have clearly seen that what happened was not punishable.”\nHe emphasized that opinions vary but stood firmly behind the regulatory bodies’ decision.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nCan Jannik Sinner's talent overshadow the doping controversy, or will it forever taint his legacy?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nThe ITIA investigated and held a hearing in August, ultimately accepting Sinner’s explanation that the banned substance entered his system unintentionally. Sinner revealed that his physiotherapist had used a spray containing the substance during a massage, leading to the accidental doping violation. The ITIA concluded that Sinner did not intentionally violate any doping regulations and decided against imposing a period of ineligibility. However, despite being cleared initially, Sinner recently accepted a three-month ban from February 9 to May 4, 2025, following a settlement with WADA.\nAs the conversation surrounding Sinner’s case continues to ignite on social media, he faces the music ahead of his return just in time for the 2025 French Open. Will he return with the same fire and continue his winning streak?\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nCan Jannik Sinner's talent overshadow the doping controversy, or will it forever taint his legacy?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"

This latest incarnation introduces StableFeel technology to increase the frameâs stability for more even more predictable shots and a bit more pop.\nAnisimova endorses the 16x19 model which has a higher launch angle and greater spin potential.

but the more visible you are, the greater that risk is and feels,\" she said.\n\"In sport, we have the situation where your body is very much on show so it makes for extra risk.\"\nWhat happened to Raducanu in Dubai?\nRaducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.\nThe 2021 US Open champion was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.\nAfter Raducanu told the WTA about the incident, tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.\nHowever, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Karolina Muchova later that evening.\nRaducanu spotted him in the front rows of the stand behind the baseline and, having become visibly upset as she told the umpire what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowd\nRaducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she went on to lose 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.\nOn Tuesday, having left Dubai, she said she was \"doing OK\" after the \"difficult circumstances\".\nMhairi Maclennan, a British long distance runner who is the co-founder of Kyniska Advocacy, which supports women and victims of abuse in sport, believes players in Raducanu's situation should leave court for an emotional welfare assessment.\n\"Speaking from my own experience, the psychological and emotional impact of something like that happening during a competition can completely derail you,\" Maclennan told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What I would have liked to have seen in this instance, and others where an athlete has been visibly shaken, is that they pause the competition where possible.\n\"In a tennis match, make sure she is able to go and see somebody.\n\"I'm not saying the result would have been different had she been able to come back later but it is about offering her a choice.\"\nHow extra security did not stop 'deeply concerning' incident\nAccording to the WTA, players are escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.\nEnhanced security is provided if a player has been the target of a credible threat.\nThe WTA, which has a full-time security arm, says extra protection was given to Raducanu after her concerns were raised.\nTournament sources insist \"efforts\" were made to identify the man before Raducanu's match.\nHowever, questions remain about how he was allowed to enter the stadium.\nHilborne believes it is \"deeply, deeply concerning\" the man was able to get so close to Raducanu.\n\"I'm not sure what happened to the security in this instance but if an athlete has already reported someone, there should be absolutely no chance that very person can turn up in that very circumstance,\" she said.\n\"You would hope the seriousness of this situation, where a woman reports someone for that type of behaviour, means there is no chance of them getting through security.\"\nDangers of 'inadvertently overexposing female athletes'\nThe WTA says player welfare and safety is a top priority, adding that safeguarding is \"an area in which we remain ever vigilant\".\nThe governing body points to the \"significant commitments\" it has made to education and training, as well as increasing staff and resources in safeguarding.\n\"Our approach recognises that effective safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when everyone involved in the game is invested and held to the same standards,\" the WTA said.\nA key concern for both Women in Sport and Kyniska Advocacy is the effect caused by elite female athletes being used as marketing tools to push the growth of women's sports.\n\"We need to stop inadvertently overexposing elite female athletes,\" said Hilborne.\n\"It is concerning is how much they are pushed to expose their personal lives through social media and are expected to put themselves at greater risk in order to generate more income for the sport.\n\"We need to be selling the skills and jeopardy of the game, rather than the individual lives.\"\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nIn 1993, world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at a WTA event in Hamburg by a crazed male fan -

                "Emma Raducanu looks on\nEmma Raducanu’s former coach Roman Kelecic has shed further light on the “terrifying” behaviour of the man who stalked the British star.\nAn unusual and concerning incident took place during\nRaducanu\n‘s 6-7(6), 4-6 loss to Karolina Muchova in the second round of the WTA 1000 event in Dubai.\nAfter falling 0-2 behind in the first set, a visibly distressed Raducanu spoke to the umpire before she hid behind the official’s chair while crying.\nMuchova consoled Raducanu, while the umpire spoke to security officials and also had a lengthy discussion with both players before the match resumed.\nA man was removed from the stadium during this break, and the WTA later revealed that the same individual had first approached Raducanu in public the day before the match.\nA statement from the WTA Tour read: “On Monday, February 17, Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour.\n“This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma’s match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected. He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment.\nThe man – confirmed to be a tourist in Dubai – has since been handed a restraining order, in return for having charges against him being dropped.\nEmma Raducanu News\nEmma Raducanu applauded for ‘playing and competing’ after shocking fan incident\nAdditional details revealed after Emma Raducanu’s Dubai ‘stalker’ gets restraining order\nKelecic coached Raducanu as a junior and worked with her at the tournaments in Abu Dhabi and Dubai this month.\nIn an interview with Croatian publication\nNet\n, Kelecic divulged that the stalker also followed Raducanu to her previous three events.\n“This man followed her to Singapore, to Abu Dhabi where I was with her, again in Doha, now in Dubai and we noticed him,” the Croatian explained.\n“But initially we thought he was a fan, an admirer, because Emma is a really big tennis star with a huge fan base. Until he got physically close to her, started having contact in the form of selfies, hugging, etc.”\nThe coach then provided terrifying insight into the man’s “calculated” plan to approach Raducanu when she was alone.\n“That was the only moment in a month where I, the fitness coach, the security guard who was with us, was not with her at that moment,” he continued.\n“So, that man was assessing the situation and looking for the best moment to get closer to her. He had a strategy that was terrifying, he thought everything through, calculated it.\n“It’s terrifying how much he, in essence, thought about it all and planned it. His strategy worked, and it was to get closer to her.\n“That evening we reported it immediately and again in the morning, when she was playing the match, because her safety is the most important thing to us.\n“Three or four hours before the match we have a photo of that stalker. Not only us, the entire security at the tournament has his photo and everyone knows who he is.\n“The first game, two points gone, 15-15, Emma is on the other side of the court and she’s showing us something. At that moment we didn’t know what it was. Emma loses the first game and runs to us, crying, shouting, ‘here he is, here he is, here he is’.”\nREAD NEXT:\nIga Swiatek reacts to Emma Raducanu’s shocking ordeal and recalls avoiding her own ‘scary’ experience"

So I hope that I can continue that trend,” she told\nCNN Sport\n.\nNaomi Osaka receives medical attention during her women's singles match against Switzerland's Belinda Bencic.\nYuichi Yamazaki/AFP/Getty Images\nThe 27-year-old has big plans for the future, and this includes seeking her fifth major title – which would be her first since becoming a mother.\n“I have a lot of goals going forward. For as long as I can play, I really want to win Wimbledon and Roland Garros (the French Open) and get a career grand slam,” she said.\n“It’s interesting when I hear from an outside perspective because, of course, all of the achievements (I’ve had so far) are great, but I always feel like there’s a lot more to do.”\nOsaka next returns to the court at the MGM Rewards Slam in Las Vegas on March 1, where she will face off with women’s world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.\n“What I’m looking forward to the most is the atmosphere. I’ve been to Las Vegas before, but obviously never to play any tennis. So that should be really exciting.\n“I rarely play exhibitions, and it’s also the lead up into Palm Springs,\nIndian Wells\n. So I hope that you know, there’s a lot of really good tennis to be played,” she said.\nAnother reason world No. 54 Osaka is excited to head to Indian Wells in the coming weeks is the return of Venus Williams. In her interview with CNN, the Japanese star expressed admiration for Williams, who recently received a wild card entry for next month’s BNP Paribas Open, in what would be the 44-year-old’s first event in almost a year.\nWilliams has not played since losing in the first round of the Miami Open in March 2024 and hasn’t won a match on tour since August 2023.\n“She’s probably the reason why I started playing,” Osaka told CNN.\n“It makes me really excited to go to the tournament and see her, and I feel like she probably doesn’t know how many people she’s inspired because even she inspired me – and through me, there’s probably other kids that are inspired. So it keeps the legacy going,” she said.\n‘There’s always another day’\nOne thing that has been a surprise to Osaka – and a boon – is motherhood, which has helped the four-time grand slam winner to see the bigger picture, she explained.\nVenus Williams competes in the Miami Open in Miami Gardens, Florida, on March 19, 2024.\nMegan Briggs/Getty Images/File\nRelated article\nVenus Williams, 44, handed wild card to play at Indian Wells\n“What I’ve learned about myself is that I’m patiently impatient,” she explained.\n“Becoming a mom, I’ve learned to become a lot more patient and sort of understand that I can’t control everything, but I can only do my best in certain situations and hope that the outcome is positive, but if not, then there’s always another day,” she added.\nOsaka has had extended breaks from competitive tennis prioritizing her mental health, before then becoming a mother to daughter Shai, who she shares with rapper Cordae.\n“I feel like it’s really important to speak about mental health, because at least for me, when I’m down, I usually feel like I’m alone and I’m the only person that feels in that specific way,” she told CNN.\n“But then you realize that there’s other people that feel the same, and you don’t feel so isolated anymore. So I think it’s important for people to keep talking about it, treat it more like physical health. I think people treat physical health a lot better than mental health.”\nHer daughter Shai, she explained, could have tennis potential.\n“She has a lot of energy, like a lot. I think she’d be a really good tennis player. She’s just the happiest girl.\n“She has a miniature racket, so she does pick that up a lot, but I haven’t put her on a tennis court yet,” she added."

                "Mirra Andreeva is enjoying the best week of her career in Dubai, as she prepares for her first WTA 1000 final.\nThe 17-year-old Russian star has impressed at the\nDubai Tennis Championships\n, securing three wins over former Major champions.\nHaving eased past Elina Avanesyan in round one,\nAndreeva beat Marketa Vondrousova\n, the 2023 Wimbledon champion in the second round, 7-5, 6-0, to book her place in the last 16.\nPhoto by Robert Prange/Getty Images\nA win against America’s Peyton Stearns followed for\nAndreeva\n, as she looked ahead to just a second career meeting with the world number two.\nIn the shock of the tournament,\nAndreeva took down Iga Swiatek\nin straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, leveling their head-to-head at 1-1.\nAndreeva then beat Elena Rybakina\nin a three-set thriller to advance to her first career WTA 1000 final, against Clara Tauson.\nHaving now beaten the\nWTA Tour’s\ntop two players, Andreeva took the time to give her honest opinions on the world number one and two.\nMirra Andreeva says Aryna Sabalenka has ‘power’ while Iga Swiatek has ‘placement’\nDuring her post-match press conference, following her quarter-final win in Dubai, Andreeva was asked to explain the differences between playing Swiatek and\nAryna Sabalenka\n.\n“Well, I think that Aryna [Sabalenka], she’s a very, very powerful player,” she said.\nMore Tennis News\n“She will always go for her shots.\n“I wouldn’t even say that she plays flat because she has such an active spin on her shots.\n“For me that’s a difficulty to kind of keep up in the point against her.”\nPhoto by Christopher Pike/Getty Images\nAndreeva then said what\nSwiatek\ndoes that is ‘different’ to Sabalenka.\n“With Iga, I think that it’s not about the power, but it’s about the placement of her shot because she plays very close to the lines and with a great shape,” she said.\n“The ball goes very, very fast.\n“The spin that she gives to the ball makes the ball bounce even higher.\n“They are a bit different.”\nThe Russian youngster has now played seven matches against the world’s top two players, coming out victorious on two occasions.\nMatch\nWinner\nLoser\nScore\n2025

she advanced to her first Major semi-final with a three-set win over the Belarussian.\nBarring her win on the Parisian clay, Andreeva hasn’t enjoyed too much success against the world number one, as she jokingly ‘hopes’ not to play her again this year.\n“I don’t know, I’ve played Aryna so many times last year and this year twice already,” she said.\n“I hope that I’m not going to play Aryna that often\n“We’re going to see but there’s nothing I can do about it.”\nMirra Andreeva explains what she ‘knew’ she had to do to beat Iga Swiatek in Dubai\nSpeaking after her quarter-final win, Andreeva explained what she knew she had to do to beat Swiatek.\n“Well, I knew that if I don’t play aggressive by myself that she’s going to go and kill me,” she said.\nPhoto by Christopher Pike/Getty Images\n“I think everybody knows that she likes to take the ball early.\n“She doesn’t give time to her opponents, she always tries to be the first one to attack.\n“My game plan was just to play my game, that I don’t have to try and go for something that I don’t usually do.\n“I just had to keep playing my game, maybe sometimes I just told myself or kind of forced myself to be more aggressive.”\nPhoto by Christopher Pike/Getty Images\nAndreeva then revealed the tactical change she made mid-match that helped her secure the win.\n“It depends on the day, but sometimes I like to take my time,” she said.\n“Sometimes, I don’t know, I do 20 drop shots in the match.\n“I think today I did only one or two.\n“They didn’t really work, so I stopped doing them right away.\n“Yeah, just told myself to, again, go for it and forced myself to play aggressive.”\nPhoto by Christopher Pike/Getty Images\nAndreeva did indeed use the drop-shot less against Swiatek, hitting a tournament-low

He has also declined to do a video call, for security reasons. He only says that he has a single room with heating and a shower. \"Not necessarily expected in wartime,” says the former Ukrainian tennis professional who has been helping defend his country against Russian aggression for the last three years.\nThe 36-year-old from Kyiv was once ranked 13th in the world. In 2011, he reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and later defeated Spanish star Rafael Nadal twice.\nDue to a wrist injury, Dolgopolov ended his career in spring 2021. Ten months later, Russia invaded Ukraine, and Dolgopolov volunteered for military service. As a drone pilot, he helped coordinate Ukrainian attacks, came under artillery fire and feared for his life.\nDER SPIEGEL 8/2025\nThe article you are reading originally appeared in German in issue 8/2025 (February 15th, 2025) of DER SPIEGEL.\nSPIEGEL International\nDuring our conversation, he doesn’t mention the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin even a single time.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nMr. Dolgopolov, the war in your home country will soon enter its fourth year, with no end in sight. What is left of the former tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov?\nDolgopolov:\nNot much. My life couldn't be further removed from that of a professional athlete. It's not just because of the war. I loved competing, playing in front of a crowd. I don't miss the training, the constant traveling or the injuries.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat do you miss?\nDolgopolov:\nInner peace and a day without news of the deaths of children, civilians and fellow soldiers. It's difficult to miss peace when you've never known what it's like to lose it. Today, I want nothing more than peace.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nDo you sometimes dream of the carefree days when you were a tennis pro?\nDolgopolov:\nIt happens, but it doesn't change my new reality. It's not like I wake up from the dream and want to be somewhere else. Or that I'm upset that it was just a dream. You have to deal with the difficult times. I am essentially happy to be able to defend my country.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHundreds of Ukrainian athletes and coaches have followed the example of the boxing brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko and are supporting the Ukrainian armed forces, with many fighting at the front. Did the Klitschkos serve as a role model for you as well?\nDolgopolov:\nYes. They are famous Ukrainians, great boxers, and Vitali is the mayor of my city. They use their fame and influence to talk about Ukraine and do everything they can for the survival of our country.\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov during an operation in the Kharkiv region in winter 2014\nFoto: privat\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov during training in Kyiv in fall 2014\nFoto: privat\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, your career had been over for just 10 months. You were in Turkey with your family at the time. How long did you think about joining the war effort?\nDolgopolov:\nNot long. My conscience drove me, telling me: This is something you now have to do. But I was completely unfamiliar with weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in the region of Antalya. By chance, I met a former soldier from a Turkish special forces unit there. When he heard that I wanted to go back to Ukraine, he spent a week teaching me how to shoot.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nAnd then you traveled directly to Kyiv?\nDolgopolov:\nYes. That was more difficult than I thought, because at that time the city was half surrounded by the Russian army. I bought an AR-15 rifle, camouflage clothing and a protective vest, and joined a few friends who were already serving in Kherson. They taught me the basics of military tactics, how to move in unfamiliar terrain, how to throw grenades, things like that.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat did your family think about it?\nDolgopolov:\nThey were extremely worried and tried to talk me out of it. But once I've set my mind on something, it's hard to dissuade me.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nYou had no doubts yourself?\nDolgopolov:\nOf course I did. I was nervous and had heard about the atrocities committed by the Russian army. Once there was no turning back, though, it seemed less bad than I had expected. The situation in Ukraine was threatening, but you get used to it.\n\"Sport isn't important. It's just a game.\"\nDER SPIEGEL:\nCompared to your previous life as a professional tennis player, what was the biggest adjustment for you?\nDolgopolov:\nThe lack of comfort. I was used to a cozy home, hotels during tournaments, massages, healthy food. I wanted to continue living that way after my career. I had no intention of becoming a soldier. Today, I sometimes sleep in the destroyed houses of abandoned villages, where the toilet is a hole and where cockroaches and mice abound. In such moments, I am grateful for every little thing. Once an old woman gave us grapes on the street. God, they were delicious.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow do the problems of your earlier life appear to you today?\nDolgopolov:\nInconsequential, though that’s not surprising. I used to be upset when I lost at tennis. Sure, it was my job, it was important to me. But sport isn't important. It's just a game. When a comrade has a leg blown off in front of you, your perspective on life completely changes. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nYou were deployed as a drone pilot for almost a year, serving in a unit that reports to the Ukrainian military intelligence service. What was your job?\nDolgopolov:\nGathering information. I operated civilian Mavic drones behind the front lines, taking aerial video of the terrain and of Russian weapons and positions. This allowed our command to follow what was happening in the combat zone in real time and to determine which targets the artillery should fire on.\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov piloting a drone not far from Kyiv in summer 2024\nFoto: privat\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov playing a match in Rome in 2018\nFoto: A; Alfredo Falcone / LaPresse \" / LaPresse / IMAGO\nDER SPIEGEL:\nIt sounds a bit like a computer game.\nDolgopolov:\nThe enemy is often invisible, hiding somewhere in the distance. But you still want to kill him because he wants to kill you too.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nDid you use the drones to transport explosives?\nDolgopolov:\nYes, grenades. But it would occasionally come to pass that we would shoot down our own drones. Or that the Russians would find us. It almost cost me my life once.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat happened?\nDolgopolov:\nIn late summer 2023, my unit was traveling in the Zaporizhzhia region. We were taking drone footage of the terrain when we were suddenly fired on with 120-millimeter mortar shells. We jumped into a trench, but the detonations kept getting closer and closer, shaking us violently. You have to understand: If shells of this caliber strike less than eight meters away from you, it can rip your guts out.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat did you do?\nDolgopolov:\nAt first, we joked around and cursed at the Russians. Then we wanted to run back to the car, but that was too dangerous. So we counted the seconds between the explosions and figured out how long they needed to reload. In the end, we just hoped that we wouldn't get hit. We were scared shitless. After about 20 strikes, it stopped.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nAnd then?\nDolgopolov:\nWe went back to our car and did a few more reconnaissance flights with the drones. It's crazy when I think about it now.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nYou weren’t injured?\nDolgopolov:\nNot quite. We all had concussions from the shock waves from the explosions. I had severe headaches and earaches and had to go to the hospital for a week. Still, we were incredibly lucky.\n\"I'm more afraid of being injured and having to live as an invalid. If I could choose, I would rather be dead.\"\nDER SPIEGEL:\nIn such situations, do you start wondering why you are doing all this?\nDolgopolov:\nNo. I knew that I could be injured or even killed in the line of duty before I enlisted.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow afraid are you of death?\nDolgopolov:\nTo be honest, I'm more afraid of being injured and having to live as an invalid. If I could choose, I would rather be dead.\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov playing in a the Cincinnati Open in 2015\nFoto: The Enquirer / Kareem Elgazzar / USA TODAY Network / IMAGO\nBild vergrößern\nDologopolov following a Wimbledon match against Roger Federer in 2017\nFoto: Han Yan / Xinhua / IMAGO\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhy?\nDolgopolov:\nI've had a great career, a good life, I've always been active, and I'm still physically fit. Eking out an existence as an invalid is not my idea of a fulfilled life.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHave you made preparations in case something happens?\nDolgopolov:\nI've discussed everything with my family. My estate is in order.\n\"You want to kill the enemy, because he wants to kill you too.\"\nDER SPIEGEL:\nIs money less important to you now that you could die at any moment?\nDolgopolov:\nIt's still important, even more so in war. It can make life more bearable. You can rent a better-equipped apartment at the deployment site, I can afford better drones, higher-quality gasoline for the car.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nYou played tennis at the highest of levels for many years. How much does that experience help you now as a soldier?\nDolgopolov:\nTennis prepared me for war. The skills you need as an athlete and as a soldier are similar: You have to be able to react quickly, concentrate and adapt to new situations.\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov taking a selfie with a fan at the U.S. Open in 2017\nFoto: Copyright: xzhukovskyx via / Depositphotos / IMAGO\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov in summer 2023 in the Zaporizhzhia region\nFoto: privat\nDER SPIEGEL:\nYou beat Rafael Nadal twice, once in 2014 in Indian Wells, California, and once in 2015 in London. Did you learn anything from those matches that you can draw on today?\nDolgopolov:\nTo keep your nerve at the decisive moment. In the matches against Nadal, the biggest challenge was to stay cool and play my game right through to the end, just before victory, when the adrenaline is pumping through your body. To do that, you need a certain amount of confidence in your own strength, and you can't let yourself get nervous.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nThe trick is not to think?\nDolgopolov:\nIt's a fine line. You can't completely shut out your thoughts. You have to weigh up how you play, what you risk and when, and which shots you feel confident about at the moment. On the other hand, the longer the match lasts, the less it's a matter of psychology and more a matter of physical endurance.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow do you keep a clear head during dangerous missions?\nDolgopolov:\nSimilar to when I played tennis. I try to stay calm, focus fully on my operation and get into a kind of flow state. This means that I block out everything around me and become one with my task, so that every movement feels easy and fluid. It helps to remind myself that any lapse in concentration could cost me my life. It sharpens your senses.\n\"You feel empty and angry at your enemy.\"\nDER SPIEGEL:\nIt sounds like tennis and war are comparable.\nDolgopolov:\nThey are! On the court, you are fighting to win; on the battlefield, you are fighting for your life. You sweat, you exhaust yourself, you get injured. Is war physically harder? It's hard to say. It's more psychologically challenging. And I haven’t even been directly involved in the fighting. I have only seen people die through the drone camera.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nAre you haunted by such images?\nDolgopolov:\nNot so far. It would likely be different if I were there live on the ground during combat operations.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat do your days look like?\nDolgopolov:\nThat depends on my tasks. During operations, we are often in our position from 4 a.m. and you sometimes work 15 or 16 hours at a time, sleeping only two hours or not at all. It's hard, sometimes you feel like a zombie. Often one day is like the next – like in the movie \"Groundhog Day.” Do you know it?\nDER SPIEGEL:\nThe one where the weatherman gets caught in a time loop and has to experience the same day over and over again.\nDolgopolov:\nThat's what war feels like. Another rocket attack, more dead people, more suffering. You're trapped in a seemingly endless downward spiral.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow do you switch off?\nDolgopolov:\nWhen I'm on leave in Kyiv, I go to the movies, eat out, meet up with friends. But I can never really switch off. I spend too much time scrolling through the news and social networks for that.\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov in the Donbas in December 2024\nFoto: privat\nDER SPIEGEL:\nDoesn't what you see on these channels weigh on you?\nDolgopolov:\nMaybe, but I can't help it. I want to know what's happening in the world and in Ukraine. This war is now my life.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat frustrates you the most?\nDolgopolov:\nStagnation. When you've been watching the enemy for weeks, gathering information, waiting, hoping that the big counteroffensive will finally start. But in the end, nothing happens. When you see your comrades dying, it's demoralizing.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow many comrades have you lost so far?\nDolgopolov:\nIt’s less than 100, but people I worked closely with and liked.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow do you deal with that?\nDolgopolov:\nThere is no recipe; you just have to learn to live with the pain. After a while, you toughen up and let it get to you less. A commander once advised me not to become too attached to my comrades in order to make the loss more bearable.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nDo you feel the need for revenge?\nDolgopolov:\nOf course. You feel empty and angry at your enemy. You want to work better, take revenge, kill the enemy. That's the meaning of war. But that doesn't bring back the lost men. And the longer the war lasts, the more people die.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow has the war changed you?\nDolgopolov:\nI've become more serious and have lost the lightness I used to have. I don't know if it will ever come back. Besides, the war has made me more aggressive.\n\"If someone says something stupid to me on the street or online, I react more strongly than I used to.\"\nDER SPIEGEL:\nIn what way?\nDolgopolov:\nIf someone says something stupid to me on the street or online, I react more strongly than I used to. I get angry quickly. My nerves are probably fragile from all the operations, I have no other explanation.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nA few weeks after the attack began, you accused the Russian tennis pro Andrey Rublev on Twitter (now X) of not taking a clear enough stand against the Russian invasion. Would you do it again?\nDolgopolov:\nAt the time, I thought it was justified. Today, I wouldn't do it again because it doesn't change anything. Getting involved in all the debates and criticism only takes up time and wears on your nerves.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHave you become more indifferent?\nDolgopolov:\nAs far as the hatred on the internet is concerned, yes. I had to learn to manage my energy. That also means ignoring discussions, otherwise I get annoyed unnecessarily.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHave you ever spoken to Rublev or any other Russian athlete in person?\nDolgopolov:\nNo. A Russian tennis player sent me a WhatsApp message shortly after the Russians bombed a Ukrainian children's hospital and asked how I was doing, with a smiley face. I sat there for two hours and didn't know what to say. I mean, was he serious? How can you be so uncaring, so cynical, so ignorant?\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat did you answer?\nDolgopolov:\nWith one word. Funny!\nDER SPIEGEL:\nThe debate about banning Russian athletes from international competitions seems to have largely died down. Tennis players like the Russian Daniil Medvedev were allowed to compete in the Olympics and at Grand Slam tournaments like the recent Australian Open.\nDolgopolov:\nIt is a sad indictment of the tennis community and the Olympics organizers. It shows that sports cannot escape global politics and the decisions of the powerful. Yet the complete exclusion of Russian athletes would be a good way to put pressure on Moscow.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nBecause economic sanctions are hardly effective?\nDolgopolov:\nAt least they are not having the effects the West had hoped for. And they are easy to get around. You get the feeling that for Russia, everything is business as usual.\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov as a soldier in the region of Zaporizhzhia in summer 2023.\nFoto: privat\nBild vergrößern\nDolgopolov (left) with his sister and parents in the early 1990s.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nThe morale of the Ukrainian armed forces is being tested more and more with each passing month. What keeps you going?\nDolgopolov:\nMy motivation is that I have no choice. If we want to free ourselves from the Russian invasion, we have to fight.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nDo you feel any support from the West?\nDolgopolov:\nI think that decision-making processes and aid deliveries are moving much too slowly. This war has been going on for three years, but we still have to beg for everything. Tanks, missiles, airplanes. Russia has enough reserves and allies to continue the war. The shells that North Korea recently delivered are just one example among many. We, on the other hand, lack materiel at every turn.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat does that mean for you personally?\nDolgopolov:\nInstead of armored vehicles, we sometimes advanced using Nissan SUVs. One time, one of these cars hit an anti-personnel mine and was hurled through the air by the explosion. Fortunately, everyone survived, but one man lost his leg.\n\"I don't have much hope.\"\nDER SPIEGEL:\nHow does that make you and your comrades feel?\nDolgopolov:\nThat we are just a tool meant to weaken Russia. But no ally is doing everything in its power to help us. They send us outdated equipment or what NATO no longer needs. We only get small amounts of newer equipment, and sometimes it arrives far too late.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nThat doesn't sound particularly hopeful.\nDolgopolov:\nI don't have much hope.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat expectations do you have of U.S. President Donald Trump?\nDolgopolov:\nThat the U.S. will send additional military equipment. On the other hand, Trump is unpredictable. That worries me. Without the U.S. at our side, it will be difficult to stand up to Russia in the long term.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nOne of the main problems is the shortage of personnel in the Ukrainian armed forces. The U.S. has therefore proposed lowering the age for military service from 25 to 18.\nDolgopolov:\nThe idea is nonsensical and would not solve the personnel problem. On the contrary: the young guys would just be cannon fodder, we would be burning the future of our country. Before we recruit young people, we need more weapons. And we need to train our people better.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat form could that take?\nDolgopolov:\nI recently worked with a team to produce training videos for soldiers that they can download or watch on YouTube. In them, we show simple strength exercises such as push-ups, sit-ups and other exercises that they can do at the deployment site where there is no mobile training equipment.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhy is fitness training so important? Isn't war exhausting enough?\nDolgopolov:\nYes, it is. But some recruits can't even run for five minutes straight or climb out of their foxhole. Without a fit heart and lungs, you can't survive months of combat. And the longer the war lasts, the more you risk injuries to your knees and back.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nAre you worried about your physical and mental stamina?\nDolgopolov:\nI train and meditate as often as possible.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nWhat are your plans for the future?\nDolgopolov:\nSince I've been a soldier, I don't plan much anymore. I've learned to live from day to day, because anything can happen at any time. Right now, I just want to survive.\nDER SPIEGEL:\nMr. Dolgopolov, thank you for this interview."

                "Image source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu became emotional when she saw a 'fixated' man during her second-round match in Dubai on Tuesday\nJonathan Jurejko\nBBC Sport tennis news reporter\nPublished\n21 February 2025\nBritish tennis player Emma Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting a man who had \"exhibited fixated behaviour\" was a distressing scene.\nIt provided a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.\nThe man was\ndetained by police\nfollowing the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday and given a restraining order.\n\"When you know it can get that far, that you feel a person is so obsessed with you, that they'll find a way into your court, it's very, very stressful,\" former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBBC Sport looks at why female athletes continue to hold fears, the security measures which are in place to protect them and what more can be done to ensure they feel safer.\nThe 'extra risk' faced by female athletes\nApproximately one in five women experience stalking in their lifetime, according to the UK's Office of National Statistics.\nBeing a well-known public personality increases exposure and a number of female tennis players have been subjected to predatory behaviour in recent years.\nRaducanu, 22, has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man\ngiven a five-year restraining order in 2022\nafter he walked 23 miles to her home.\nFellow British player Katie Boulter\ndescribed to the Guardian last year\n,\nexternal\nhow she had been followed by people in a car and on foot, while American players\nDanielle Collins\n,\nexternal\nand Sloane Stephens have also highlighted the harassment which they have faced.\nA man\nwas charged last month\nwith stalking American basketball player Caitlin Clark, while sprinter Gabby Thomas and rugby player Ilona Maher have recently spoken out about their fears.\nBartoli recalled a similar harrowing experience during a match at the All England Club in 2007.\nBartoli described how a man followed her throughout the British grass-court season, turning up at the Birmingham and Eastbourne events before pretending to be a member of the Wimbledon groundstaff to get nearer to her.\n\"He found a way to purchase the same kit and get himself into my courts,\" she added.\n\"I recognised him during my first-round match against Flavia Pennetta and I pointed it out straight away.\n\"I said he was not a groundsperson, he was not working there, he was someone who has been stalking me for three weeks.\"\nStephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that \"every single woman has a level of fear\".\n\"That's not restricted to the more visible women - but the more visible you are, the greater that risk is and feels,\" she said.\n\"In sport, we have the situation where your body is very much on show so it makes for extra risk.\"\nWhat happened to Raducanu in Dubai?\nRaducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.\nThe 2021 US Open champion was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.\nAfter Raducanu told the WTA about the incident, tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.\nHowever, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Karolina Muchova later that evening.\nRaducanu spotted him in the front rows of the stand behind the baseline and, having become visibly upset as she told the umpire what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowd\nRaducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she went on to lose 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.\nOn Tuesday, having left Dubai, she said she was \"doing OK\" after the \"difficult circumstances\".\nMhairi Maclennan, a British long distance runner who is the co-founder of Kyniska Advocacy, which supports women and victims of abuse in sport, believes players in Raducanu's situation should leave court for an emotional welfare assessment.\n\"Speaking from my own experience, the psychological and emotional impact of something like that happening during a competition can completely derail you,\" Maclennan told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What I would have liked to have seen in this instance, and others where an athlete has been visibly shaken, is that they pause the competition where possible.\n\"In a tennis match, make sure she is able to go and see somebody.\n\"I'm not saying the result would have been different had she been able to come back later but it is about offering her a choice.\"\nHow extra security did not stop 'deeply concerning' incident\nAccording to the WTA, players are escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.\nEnhanced security is provided if a player has been the target of a credible threat.\nThe WTA, which has a full-time security arm, says extra protection was given to Raducanu after her concerns were raised.\nTournament sources insist \"efforts\" were made to identify the man before Raducanu's match.\nHowever, questions remain about how he was allowed to enter the stadium.\nHilborne believes it is \"deeply, deeply concerning\" the man was able to get so close to Raducanu.\n\"I'm not sure what happened to the security in this instance but if an athlete has already reported someone, there should be absolutely no chance that very person can turn up in that very circumstance,\" she said.\n\"You would hope the seriousness of this situation, where a woman reports someone for that type of behaviour, means there is no chance of them getting through security.\"\nDangers of 'inadvertently overexposing female athletes'\nThe WTA says player welfare and safety is a top priority, adding that safeguarding is \"an area in which we remain ever vigilant\".\nThe governing body points to the \"significant commitments\" it has made to education and training, as well as increasing staff and resources in safeguarding.\n\"Our approach recognises that effective safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when everyone involved in the game is invested and held to the same standards,\" the WTA said.\nA key concern for both Women in Sport and Kyniska Advocacy is the effect caused by elite female athletes being used as marketing tools to push the growth of women's sports.\n\"We need to stop inadvertently overexposing elite female athletes,\" said Hilborne.\n\"It is concerning is how much they are pushed to expose their personal lives through social media and are expected to put themselves at greater risk in order to generate more income for the sport.\n\"We need to be selling the skills and jeopardy of the game, rather than the individual lives.\"\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nIn 1993, world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at a WTA event in Hamburg by a crazed male fan - an incident which is still the most notorious act of violence towards a tennis player\nAnti-misogyny policies, introduced as a condition of funding being given to sports, should also be mandatory, according to Women in Sport.\nIt has demanded social media accounts spreading misogynistic messages to be deactivated and reiterated its call for an independent sporting regulator to handle reports of misogyny.\nHilborne also wants men to \"stand up with women to address the system\".\n\"When you get a brilliant tennis player like Emma who you want to celebrate, you don't want to deal with these negative aspects - you want to celebrate their play and the story of the sport,\" said Hilborne.\n\"But when this does happen, we're reminded there has not been enough action.

                "Sinner 'has timed it all as sweetly as one of his whiplash forehand'\n(Image credit: Andy Cheung / Contributor / Getty Images)\nBy\nThe Week UK\npublished\n22 February 2025\nNick Kyrgios called it a \"sad day for tennis\"; Tim Henman said it \"leaves a pretty sour taste\". Last Saturday, it was announced that the world's best player, Jannik Sinner, had negotiated a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over offences committed last March, and would be banned for just three months.\nSinner twice tested positive for the\nbanned steroid\nclostebol, said Stuart Fraser in\nThe Times\n. He claimed the substance had entered his system accidentally, as a result of it being present in an over-the-counter spray used by his physiotherapist to treat a small wound. And last August, a tribunal cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing. But that decision was appealed by\nWada\n, on the grounds that even if the Italian wasn't personally at fault, he was still responsible for mistakes by his team. At a hearing scheduled for April, Wada said it would seek a one-year ban. But a compromise agreement has been reached which bans Sinner until 4 May – allowing him to return for the French Open.\nThis outcome fits Sinner's interests so precisely as to almost seem like no punishment at all, said Simon Briggs in\nThe Daily Telegraph\n. Had his ban started after Wada's appeal was due to be heard, he would have missed both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. As it is, he will be able to put his feet up during the \"dog days of late winter and early spring\", before returning for the crucial summer tournaments.\nSubscribe to\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Sinner's case, and that of women's No. 2\nIga Swiatek\n(who last year received a month-long ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance), contrast starkly with that of some lower-ranked players. Take Britain's Tara Moore, who in 2022 was banned after testing positive for nandrolone metabolites and Boldenone. After 19 months of tortuous wrangling, \"the source was found to be contaminated meat at a local restaurant\", and Moore was cleared. But \"the saga evaporated her life savings and stuck her £200,000 in debt\". Her career has never recovered. Sinner gets a free pass; yet when lower-ranked players face career-threatening charges, the sport does next to nothing to help.\nSome action is at least on the horizon, said Charlie Eccleshare on\nThe Athletic\n. The Professional Tennis Players Association recently announced plans to give all players access to pro-bono legal support. That may help players in Moore's situation, but won't do much to shift the general perception that tennis is a sport that gives \"preferential treatment\" to its elites. The \"two-tiered resentment\" this generates, and which Sinner's case has so clearly illustrated, \"does not look likely to fade away any time soon\".\nExplore More\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe Week UK\nLatest\nCrossword: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku hard: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku medium: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nYou might also like\nWhen 'a kiss is not a kiss': Spanish football on trial\nTalking Point\nLuis Rubiales faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail if convicted of sexually assaulting footballer Jenni Hermoso\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n15 February 25\nDenis Law obituary: fond farewell to 'the King of the Stretford End'\nIn the Spotlight\nScottish footballer who was one of Manchester United's 'Holy Trinity' has died aged 84\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n25 January 25\nWhy Man United finally lost patience with ten Hag\nTalking Point\nAfter another loss United sacked ten Hag in hopes of success in the Champion's League\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n3 November 24\nGeoff Capes obituary: shot-putter who became the World’s Strongest Man\nIn the Spotlight\nThe 'mighty figure' was a two-time Commonwealth Champion and world-record holder\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n2 November 24\nDignity in defeat\nOpinion\nChicago White Sox players during a baseball game in Detroit, Michigan\nBy Theunis Bates\nPublished\n1 October 24\nRaygun: heir to Eddie the Eagle?\nTalking Point\nAustralian Olympic breakdancer Rachael Gunn has become 'a worldwide meme'\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n24 August 24\nGraham Thorpe obituary: 'chameleon' batsman with 100 England caps\nIn depth\nCricketer's 'bottle in abundance' endeared him to fans\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n18 August 24\nBoxing at the Olympics: the row over sexual differences\nTalking Point\nControversy over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shines a spotlight on the murky world of gender testing – and the IOC's inaction\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n10 August 24\nView More ▸"

However, his current existence is a stark contrast to his former life, with survival now his primary goal.\nThe Ukrainian, who peaked at number 13 in the\nATP rankings\nin 2012, and regularly faced off against the likes of Roger Federer and\nNovak Djokovic\n, even defeated\nRafael Nadal\nin 2014 and 2015. But when\nRussia\n, under Vladimir Putin's command, invaded\nUkraine\nin February 2022, Dolgopolov felt compelled to act.\nA self-proclaimed patriot, he didn't hesitate to swap his tennis racket for a firearm and head to the front lines. \"My conscience drove me [saying] 'you have to do it now',\" he said. \"But I had no idea about weapons. So I looked for the nearest shooting range in Antalya.\"\nSpeaking to German publication\nDer Spiegel\n, Dolgopolov, who now serves as a drone pilot, shared insights into his daily life at war, reports\nthe Express\n. \"Basically, I am happy to be able to defend my country, but I want nothing more than peace,\" he said.\n\"I lack inner peace and a day without news of children, civilians, and comrades being killed.\" The 36-year-old also shared some of his harrowing experiences while fighting.\nInstagram\n\"In late summer 2023, my unit was in the Zaporizhia region,\" he said. \"We were filming the terrain with a drone when suddenly we were attacked. We jumped into a trench, but the impacts came closer and shook us violently.\n\"You have to understand that if grenades of this size fall less than eight metres from you, they can tear your insides apart. In the end, all we could do was hope it wouldn't happen to us. We were scared to death. After about 20 hits it stopped. It's crazy when I think about it in retrospect.\"\nFollowing the incident, Dolgopolov was hospitalised with a concussion for a week, yet he's now haunted daily by the spectre of mortality, confessing a fear greater than death itself. \"To be honest, I am more afraid of being injured and having to live life as a cripple. If I could choose, I would prefer to be dead,\" he said.\nWhile he's managed to avoid \"direct combat\", the death he has seen through his drone camera is scarring, and the ex-ATP Tour stalwart now simply yearns to survive the ordeal.\n\"Right now I just want to survive,\" he said. \"When a friend loses a leg right before your eyes, it gives you a new perspective on life.

Seriously, that metallic dress? She absolutely\nslayed\n. It was a true ‘style maven’ moment, especially considering what she’s been through. You know, since her knee injury at 2023 Wimbledon, she’s been in recovery mode for almost a year. Everything aside, she has stepped out once again. This time at Dior, the $12.5 billion brand’s fashion gala. You know what’s special this time?\nOn Friday, Williams posted her jaw-dropping look from Dior’s D-Journey bag launch event. The D-Journey bag is a brand new accessory introduced by the French luxury goods brand. It’s part of Dior’s\n“spring-summer 2025 ready-to-wear collection – is distinguished by its silhouette of softened lines, at once timeless and ultra-contemporary. Made using savoir-faire of excellence, this unique creation reflects the virtuosity of Dior’s leather goods ateliers,”\nreads the official description on the brand’s website.\nIn her Instagram story, dated February 21, Venus, who’s the Capture Ambassador of Dior, was seen flaunting the stylish bag. She was wearing an all-black jumpsuit. It had a zip front, a cinched drawcord waist, and small pockets on the hip side. Along with her, other famous names like Latino singer Becky-G and actress Jenna Ortega were also seen posing with the D-Journey bag.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Dior Official (@dior)\nEven last month, at Christian Dior’s Couture Spring 2025 show, the elder Williams sister was seen showcasing her attractive side. Sharing a post on her Instagram, dated January 28, she wrote,\n“Parisian dreams @dior 🖤 #DiorHauteCouture.”\nAdmiring her for being a part of its show, the brand’s official account wrote,\n“You made the dream even more special, Venus✨”\nIt’s just amazing to see this stylish side of Williams. But what about her tennis comeback?\nVenus Williams to return on the court in March with the Indian Wells\nBack in January 2024,\nVenus Williams\nshowed a strong urge to keep playing despite missing in action. “\nMy little sister, Serena, told me I’m not allowed to quit, and of course, I would never quit. But it’s the mandate. She said no, so I will be back on the court.\n”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nVenus Williams: Fashion icon or tennis legend—where does her true legacy lie?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nEarlier this week, she dropped a cryptic image on her Instagram. The 44-year-old was seen working out on the court as she captioned the post,\n“Lavender afternoons💜”\nApart from this update, the former World No.1 didn’t provide much details. But the post was enough to spark rumors of a big announcement of her comeback. And guess what?\nHours after her initial post on IG, it was confirmed that\nWilliams has received a wildcard entry\nfor next month’s BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Due to the injury and an extended break, her ranking fell too low, at 974, to get a straight ticket into the event. With the wildcard, she will make her 10th overall appearance at the event, often dubbed the\n“fifth slam”\ndue to high attendance of fans.\nInterestingly, Williams had refused to compete at this tournament fifteen years ago. But bygones are bygones now. It’s time to look forward. Speaking of her record in Indian Wells, she has delivered some great performances in the past. On three occasions (1998, 2001, and 2018), she made it to the SF round. Her recent stints, however, haven’t yielded great results.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nLast season, before going on a recovery break, she failed to impress at the BNP Paribas Open. Japan’s Nao Hibino beat her 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 in the first round itself. Can Williams make a solid comeback in 2025? Only time will tell.\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nVenus Williams: Fashion icon or tennis legend—where does her true legacy lie?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"

an end, as two new stars look to have taken their place.\nRoger Federer\n, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic won a combined 66 Major titles during their careers, numbers that may well never be topped.\nPhoto by Julian Finney/Getty Images for Laver Cup\nJannik Sinner and\nCarlos Alcaraz\nwill give it their all, however, and have already picked up seven Grand Slams between them at 23 and 21

have won eight Major titles since then as they look to match her legacy.\nWhile\nSinner\n, Alcaraz, Swiatek, and Sabalenka all have the potential to live up to the greatness of their predecessors, it could well be two even younger players, that truly break out as tennis’ next ‘superstars.’\nMirra Andreeva and Joao Fonseca could break through as the next tennis ‘superstars’\nTennis fans around the

                "(Image credit: Getty Images)\nBy\nCharlie Elizabeth Culverhouse\npublished\n21 February 2025\nin\nNews\nLook no further for your go-to spring outfit than Serena Williams' baggy jeans and simple white top combination - with her pastel Burberry handbag bringing in a pop of pretty colour, the look is so elegant yet easy to pull-together yourself.\nSerena Williams may be best known for her incredible sporting achievements on the tennis court, but when she's off-duty, her style is just as impeccable as her powerful serves - and her latest look proves just that.\nTaking to Instagram to show off her elegant way of applying perfume, Serena wore everyone's go-to outfit formula of jeans and a nice top. But these weren't just any\ncomfortable denim jeans\n- she elevated the\nspring capsule wardrobe\nstaple by opting for a pair of baggy, straight-leg jeans with a flattering mid-rise waist and brought in some seasonal brightness by pairing them with a crisp white corset-style top and some stylish light pink trainers. Oh, and the handbag? It's one of the\nmost timeless designer handbags\nfrom Burberry and the pastel colour is so striking.\nA post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)\nA photo posted by on\nShop Serena's Look\nM&S Mid Rise Wide Leg Jeans with Lyocell\nThese M&S jeans look so much like Serena's stylish pair with their slouchy, wide leg fit, mid-rise waist and self-tie belt made of string at the waist.\nEdikted Juno Corset Crop Camisole\nWith adjustable straps, you can alter where the straight neckline of this flattering corset top falls to get a more modest, or more sultry, look.\nHOKA Kawana 2 Running Shoe\nHOKA make some of the\nbest running shoes\nand they're great for everyday wear too. With a comfortable fit and cushioned soles, this pair will add a pop of pink to any look.\nMali + Lili Convertible Sling Bag\nMade from a soft faux-leather fabric, this unique handbag is a stunning pastel piece that will bring colour to any laid-back look this spring.\nPacSun Lena Low Rise Super Baggy Wide Leg Jeans\nWith a baggy, full-length leg that keeps its structure and gives an elevated look thanks to the non-stretch denim, these mid-rise jeans are super flattering and easy to style.\nHoff City Mkii Trainer Athens Ii\nHoff trainers are super on trend at the moment, with celebrities like Sienna Miller being spotted in them when off-duty. This pink pair are currently on sale and their colour is stunning.\nThe outfit is a real masterclass in styling fun yet simple outfits that can work for any day-to-day occasion, whether you want to make a splash as you run errands or are heading for a lunch date. Or just one of those days where you want to feel comfortable but also put-together.\nSerena's denim is the perfect relaxed-fit pair of\nwide leg jeans\n, with their flattering mid-rise waist sitting on her hips and showing off just a slither of skin for a modest yet sultry touch that looks oh-so chic. Their weathered blue denim is bright and bold while also feeling casual and laid-back, which works brilliantly with the baggy fit, and the tie-string detail that she's done up in a sweet bow brings a lovely feminine flair to the oversized style.\nLeaning into the brighter blue of her jeans, Serena kept the crisp and spring-ready feel going by adding a clean white top to the outfit. With simple straps, a straight-cut neckline and a corset-style waved hemline, the simple silhouette is impossibly flattering. A basic piece that oozes effortless elegance, the top is a great alternative to the T-shirts we tend to pair jeans with and brings in a much more elevated feel.\nWhile a pair of your\nbest white trainers\nwould finish off this outfit perfectly, Serena brought tonnes more personality and fun into the look by opting for a pale pink trainer. With a thick, bouncy sole, the pair look super comfortable for all-day wear and the pastel pink shade ties in the beautiful light blue of her handbag, with both colourful accessories introducing a lovely spring-like feel to the outfit.\nSign up to the woman&home newsletter\nSign up to our free daily email for the latest royal and entertainment news, interesting opinion, expert advice on styling and beauty trends, and no-nonsense guides to the health and wellness questions you want answered.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nSerena's bag is the Burberry DK88 Trench Bag. It's named as such because it's the perfect size to carry a\nBurberry trench coat\nin and this detail, as well as its stunningly luxe look, means it generated much fanfare when it released in 2017 and its quickly become one of the brand's most iconic styles; so much so that it sold out and is only rarely spotted on resale sites - so keep your eyes peeled for when it does pop up.\nBut while we might not be able to carry our own DK88s around, we can take inspiration from Serena and incorporate fun, spring-ready pastel handbags into our simple, off-duty looks. Pastel tones like the blue of her bag can bring in a retro-feeling colour to any look and elevate it into something timeless and classic that still feels fresh, contemporary and fun - and pastels for spring is always going to be on trend.\nCharlie Elizabeth Culverhouse\nFreelance news writer\nCharlie Elizabeth Culverhouse is a freelance royal news, entertainment and fashion writer.

The translation, in this case, means Knockout Blow.\nFor now, yes,\nWembanyama’s season has been dealt a knockout blow.\nDeep vein thrombosis in the right shoulder is the diagnosis,\nmeaning he has a blood clot.\nThe Spurs, in consultation with their medical team, quickly determined that Wembanyama will not play again this season. That’s the bad news. The good news is that those same doctors have told the Spurs that they believe this is not a career-threatening issue.\n“I know Victor loves to play the game,” acting Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. “You saw how he competed during All-Star weekend. And he wants to be with his teammates. I know that. He’d want to finish this thing out.”\nAll the Spurs have said, in terms of specifics about Wembanyama’s health, is that the diagnosis was DVT and that they are hopeful of a full recovery. But the location of the clot — Wembanyama’s upper body — might provide a good reason for the optimism.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nJalen Green scores 35 points to lead Rockets past Timberwolves 121-115\nHield, Moody lead Warriors with 22 points each in 132-106 blowout over Kings\nWest-leading Thunder beat the Jazz 130-107 for 8th victory in 9 games\nThere is a type of DVT that appears when a blood vessel in someone’s upper arm can be compressed by a rib (the top rib is removed in some cases to relieve the compression, if that is the cause) or a muscle. The Spurs have not said if that is the sort of issue that Wembanyama is currently dealing with, but if that is the case then the belief that he could be ready to play again in a few months would seem valid.\nDoctors will determine, if they haven’t already, how the clot formed and why it is in his shoulder. Most importantly, they will ascertain if the clot was unprovoked (which would be bad) or provoked (which would be good and would likely rule out a genetic issue).\n“You just wish for him to be healthy, period,” Spurs guard De’Aaron Fox told TNT in the on-court postgame interview after San Antonio — in its first game since the diagnosis — beat Phoenix on Thursday night. “No matter if he’s able to play basketball or not, you just want him to be healthy.”\nIt has been a season with major health issues for the Spurs, affecting probably the two most important people in the organization. Gregg Popovich, the NBA’s all-time win leader and longest-tenured current coach,\nhad a stroke in early November;\nhe’s improving but has not coached since, which is why Johnson has assumed the acting role. And now, Wembanyama is sidelined as well.\nThe 7-foot-3 center from France was averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, 3.8 blocks and 3.7 assists this season, well on his way to probably winning defensive player of the year and perhaps earning an All-NBA team nod as well.\nChris Paul came to San Antonio last summer to play for Popovich and play with Wembanyama. Fox was acquired in a trade earlier this month so he could team up with Wembanyama. Obviously, things have not gone as planned and San Antonio is facing a bit of a climb in the final seven weeks of the season just to get into the play-in tournament in the loaded Western Conference.\n“I’m thinking about Vic,” Phoenix All-Star forward Kevin Durant said. “I’m sure the whole basketball world is thinking about him right now. Somebody like that who has a strong mind, strong will to go out there and recover and get better … I don’t even know Vic well, but I can just tell that’s what he’s about. That’s his makeup. And I’m looking forward to seeing him back out there.”\nPlenty of athletes have dealt with the clotting issue before, and it is certainly not a one-size-fits-all problem.\nSerena Williams came back to dominate women’s tennis after a clotting issue following the birth of her daughter; Williams needed four surgeries to address the matter. Chris Bosh had to eventually retire from basketball after he was diagnosed with clots. In hockey, Tomas Fleischmann developed clots and went on to play for years afterward; Tomas Vokoun needed surgery to relieve his clotting problem and never played in the NHL again.\nThe earliest that Wembanyama might play a real game again is August, and that’s if he decides to join France for the European championships — one of the biggest tournaments in the world. Wembanyama spoke at length last summer during the Paris Olympics about how much wearing his country’s uniform means to him, so it seems logical that he would at least strongly consider participating if he was medically cleared to do so.\nBoris Diaw, who spent time playing for San Antonio and is still beloved by the organization, runs the French basketball federation now. He’s not speculating on EuroBasket, saying those questions are for the coming months.\n“This is absolutely not the time to project ourselves on this kind of question,” Diaw told French reporters, according to L’Equipe. “I especially hope he’s well. It’s never easy to be injured for a long time, to miss a lot of games. I guess it’s hard for him, I know how much he loves to play. To be away from the courts for so long ... I can totally believe that it will be complicated for him.”\n___\nAP NBA:\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/NBA\nTIM REYNOLDS\nReynolds is an Associated Press sports writer, based in South Florida.\ntwitter\nmailto"

                "Sinner 'has timed it all as sweetly as one of his whiplash forehand'\n(Image credit: Andy Cheung / Contributor / Getty Images)\nBy\nThe Week UK\npublished\n22 February 2025\nNick Kyrgios called it a \"sad day for tennis\"; Tim Henman said it \"leaves a pretty sour taste\". Last Saturday, it was announced that the world's best player, Jannik Sinner, had negotiated a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over offences committed last March, and would be banned for just three months.\nSinner twice tested positive for the\nbanned steroid\nclostebol, said Stuart Fraser in\nThe Times\n. He claimed the substance had entered his system accidentally, as a result of it being present in an over-the-counter spray used by his physiotherapist to treat a small wound. And last August, a tribunal cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing. But that decision was appealed by\nWada\n, on the grounds that even if the Italian wasn't personally at fault, he was still responsible for mistakes by his team. At a hearing scheduled for April, Wada said it would seek a one-year ban. But a compromise agreement has been reached which bans Sinner until 4 May – allowing him to return for the French Open.\nThis outcome fits Sinner's interests so precisely as to almost seem like no punishment at all, said Simon Briggs in\nThe Daily Telegraph\n. Had his ban started after Wada's appeal was due to be heard, he would have missed both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. As it is, he will be able to put his feet up during the \"dog days of late winter and early spring\", before returning for the crucial summer tournaments.\nSubscribe to\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Sinner's case, and that of women's No. 2\nIga Swiatek\n(who last year received a month-long ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance), contrast starkly with that of some lower-ranked players. Take Britain's Tara Moore, who in 2022 was banned after testing positive for nandrolone metabolites and Boldenone. After 19 months of tortuous wrangling, \"the source was found to be contaminated meat at a local restaurant\", and Moore was cleared. But \"the saga evaporated her life savings and stuck her £200,000 in debt\". Her career has never recovered. Sinner gets a free pass; yet when lower-ranked players face career-threatening charges, the sport does next to nothing to help.\nSome action is at least on the horizon, said Charlie Eccleshare on\nThe Athletic\n. The Professional Tennis Players Association recently announced plans to give all players access to pro-bono legal support. That may help players in Moore's situation, but won't do much to shift the general perception that tennis is a sport that gives \"preferential treatment\" to its elites. The \"two-tiered resentment\" this generates, and which Sinner's case has so clearly illustrated, \"does not look likely to fade away any time soon\".\nExplore More\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe Week UK\nLatest\nCrossword: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku hard: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku medium: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nYou might also like\nWhen 'a kiss is not a kiss': Spanish football on trial\nTalking Point\nLuis Rubiales faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail if convicted of sexually assaulting footballer Jenni Hermoso\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n15 February 25\nDenis Law obituary: fond farewell to 'the King of the Stretford End'\nIn the Spotlight\nScottish footballer who was one of Manchester United's 'Holy Trinity' has died aged 84\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n25 January 25\nWhy Man United finally lost patience with ten Hag\nTalking Point\nAfter another loss United sacked ten Hag in hopes of success in the Champion's League\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n3 November 24\nGeoff Capes obituary: shot-putter who became the World’s Strongest Man\nIn the Spotlight\nThe 'mighty figure' was a two-time Commonwealth Champion and world-record holder\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n2 November 24\nDignity in defeat\nOpinion\nChicago White Sox players during a baseball game in Detroit, Michigan\nBy Theunis Bates\nPublished\n1 October 24\nRaygun: heir to Eddie the Eagle?\nTalking Point\nAustralian Olympic breakdancer Rachael Gunn has become 'a worldwide meme'\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n24 August 24\nGraham Thorpe obituary: 'chameleon' batsman with 100 England caps\nIn depth\nCricketer's 'bottle in abundance' endeared him to fans\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n18 August 24\nBoxing at the Olympics: the row over sexual differences\nTalking Point\nControversy over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shines a spotlight on the murky world of gender testing – and the IOC's inaction\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n10 August 24\nView More ▸"

                "Image source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu became emotional when she saw a 'fixated' man during her second-round match in Dubai on Tuesday\nJonathan Jurejko\nBBC Sport tennis news reporter\nPublished\n21 February 2025\nBritish tennis player Emma Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting a man who had \"exhibited fixated behaviour\" was a distressing scene.\nIt provided a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.\nThe man was\ndetained by police\nfollowing the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday and given a restraining order.\n\"When you know it can get that far, that you feel a person is so obsessed with you, that they'll find a way into your court, it's very, very stressful,\" former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBBC Sport looks at why female athletes continue to hold fears, the security measures which are in place to protect them and what more can be done to ensure they feel safer.\nThe 'extra risk' faced by female athletes\nApproximately one in five women experience stalking in their lifetime, according to the UK's Office of National Statistics.\nBeing a well-known public personality increases exposure and a number of female tennis players have been subjected to predatory behaviour in recent years.\nRaducanu, 22, has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man\ngiven a five-year restraining order in 2022\nafter he walked 23 miles to her home.\nFellow British player Katie Boulter\ndescribed to the Guardian last year\n,\nexternal\nhow she had been followed by people in a car and on foot, while American players\nDanielle Collins\n,\nexternal\nand Sloane Stephens have also highlighted the harassment which they have faced.\nA man\nwas charged last month\nwith stalking American basketball player Caitlin Clark, while sprinter Gabby Thomas and rugby player Ilona Maher have recently spoken out about their fears.\nBartoli recalled a similar harrowing experience during a match at the All England Club in 2007.\nBartoli described how a man followed her throughout the British grass-court season, turning up at the Birmingham and Eastbourne events before pretending to be a member of the Wimbledon groundstaff to get nearer to her.\n\"He found a way to purchase the same kit and get himself into my courts,\" she added.\n\"I recognised him during my first-round match against Flavia Pennetta and I pointed it out straight away.\n\"I said he was not a groundsperson, he was not working there, he was someone who has been stalking me for three weeks.\"\nStephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that \"every single woman has a level of fear\".\n\"That's not restricted to the more visible women - but the more visible you are, the greater that risk is and feels,\" she said.\n\"In sport, we have the situation where your body is very much on show so it makes for extra risk.\"\nWhat happened to Raducanu in Dubai?\nRaducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.\nThe 2021 US Open champion was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.\nAfter Raducanu told the WTA about the incident, tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.\nHowever, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Karolina Muchova later that evening.\nRaducanu spotted him in the front rows of the stand behind the baseline and, having become visibly upset as she told the umpire what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nEmma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowd\nRaducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she went on to lose 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.\nOn Tuesday, having left Dubai, she said she was \"doing OK\" after the \"difficult circumstances\".\nMhairi Maclennan, a British long distance runner who is the co-founder of Kyniska Advocacy, which supports women and victims of abuse in sport, believes players in Raducanu's situation should leave court for an emotional welfare assessment.\n\"Speaking from my own experience, the psychological and emotional impact of something like that happening during a competition can completely derail you,\" Maclennan told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What I would have liked to have seen in this instance, and others where an athlete has been visibly shaken, is that they pause the competition where possible.\n\"In a tennis match, make sure she is able to go and see somebody.\n\"I'm not saying the result would have been different had she been able to come back later but it is about offering her a choice.\"\nHow extra security did not stop 'deeply concerning' incident\nAccording to the WTA, players are escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.\nEnhanced security is provided if a player has been the target of a credible threat.\nThe WTA, which has a full-time security arm, says extra protection was given to Raducanu after her concerns were raised.\nTournament sources insist \"efforts\" were made to identify the man before Raducanu's match.\nHowever, questions remain about how he was allowed to enter the stadium.\nHilborne believes it is \"deeply, deeply concerning\" the man was able to get so close to Raducanu.\n\"I'm not sure what happened to the security in this instance but if an athlete has already reported someone, there should be absolutely no chance that very person can turn up in that very circumstance,\" she said.\n\"You would hope the seriousness of this situation, where a woman reports someone for that type of behaviour, means there is no chance of them getting through security.\"\nDangers of 'inadvertently overexposing female athletes'\nThe WTA says player welfare and safety is a top priority, adding that safeguarding is \"an area in which we remain ever vigilant\".\nThe governing body points to the \"significant commitments\" it has made to education and training, as well as increasing staff and resources in safeguarding.\n\"Our approach recognises that effective safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when everyone involved in the game is invested and held to the same standards,\" the WTA said.\nA key concern for both Women in Sport and Kyniska Advocacy is the effect caused by elite female athletes being used as marketing tools to push the growth of women's sports.\n\"We need to stop inadvertently overexposing elite female athletes,\" said Hilborne.\n\"It is concerning is how much they are pushed to expose their personal lives through social media and are expected to put themselves at greater risk in order to generate more income for the sport.\n\"We need to be selling the skills and jeopardy of the game, rather than the individual lives.\"\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nImage caption,\nIn 1993, world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at a WTA event in Hamburg by a crazed male fan - an incident which is still the most notorious act of violence towards a tennis player\nAnti-misogyny policies, introduced as a condition of funding being given to sports, should also be mandatory, according to Women in Sport.\nIt has demanded social media accounts spreading misogynistic messages to be deactivated and reiterated its call for an independent sporting regulator to handle reports of misogyny.\nHilborne also wants men to \"stand up with women to address the system\".\n\"When you get a brilliant tennis player like Emma who you want to celebrate, you don't want to deal with these negative aspects - you want to celebrate their play and the story of the sport,\" said Hilborne.\n\"But when this does happen, we're reminded there has not been enough action. It is unacceptable.\"\nRelated topics\nTennis\nMore on this story\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone\nPublished\n31 January"

                "Genie in a bottle, a cave of wonders, the desert rose, the mysteries of the Middle East have long intrigued the curious. While some prefer the comfort of the familiar, others are drawn to the thrill of the unknown. If you’re among the brave who dare to venture into the eerie and unexplained, then the haunted palace of Ras Al Khaimah might just give you chills.\nAn hour’s drive from glitzy Dubai and secluded deep within the vast Arabian desert, Al Qassimi Palace, also known as Al Qasr Al Gamedh, feels ripped straight from a goosebumps-inducing horror movie. Built in 1985 by the late Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Humaid Al Qassimi, a member of one of Sharjah’s six ruling families, once renowned for their powerful maritime presence in the Persian Gulf, this lavish structure was intended to be a grand royal residence.\nSheikh Abdulaziz bin Humaid Al Qassimi\nThe sheikh spared no expense, crafting a masterpiece inspired by Islamic and Arabic architectural principles.\nThe location was nothing short of spectacular, sweeping dunes, perched grandly atop a hill, a private utopia where nothing could go wrong. Except, it did, and in the most terrifying way imaginable. Despite spending a jaw-dropping AED 500 million (approximately $140 million back then) on luxurious chandeliers, rare musical instruments, global antiques, elegant sitting rooms, bedrooms, and a study, the family abandoned the palace after just one night. It wasn’t the desert’s heat or howling winds that drove them away; it was something far more chilling and paranormal than they could bear.\nAlso read -\nAn angry Texas man broke into an art museum and smashed $5 million worth of irreplaceable ancient artifacts. A pair of Greek pots were more than 2600 years old.\nThe dream home quickly turned nightmarish when the owners realized they weren’t alone. Haunted whispers echoed through the halls, and strange, otherworldly presences made their mark. The terror was so intense that the affluent owners fled, leaving behind not only their possessions but also any concern for the fortune they had poured into the palace.\nOver time, the palace fell into public lore, becoming a magnet for thrill-seekers drawn by stories of shadowy figures, eerie wails, and ghostly children peering from behind stained-glass windows. Things got morbid, fast.\nAlso read -\nThe bizarre reason why an American Tourist shattered 2000-year-old statues at an Italian museum\nSounds like a doomed palace, doesn’t it? But as the saying goes, nothing lasts forever, not even the darkest night. In 2019, after years of speculation and spine-tingling rumors, the Emirate decided to open the palace’s doors to visitors. A thorough renovation and an exorcism, just to be safe, breathed new life into the haunted halls, transforming Al Qassimi Palace into a fully-fledged\nmuseum\n.\nThe palace has been partially restored and is now a tourist attraction. Image – X / @AbandonedPicAR\nNow, you can explore its 35 rooms adorned with classical furniture and authentic art pieces, marvel at the towering pyramid structure crowning the mansion, and wander through a serene garden complete with a lake and fountain. All of this can be experienced for a mere AED 75, or AED 50 ($15-$20) if you’re visiting with a group, according to\nSceneNow\n.\nPerhaps the palace could become the home of the millionaire who\nbought the residence featured in ‘The Conjuring\n’ for a cool $1.5 million at\nSotheby’s\n."

                "Cryptocurrency theft of £1.1bn could be biggest ever\n12 hours ago\nFaarea Masud\nBBC Business reporter\nGetty Images\nCryptocurrency firm Bybit said hackers stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital currency in what could be the biggest crypto theft in history.\nThe Dubai-based company's founder told users that their funds were \"safe\" and that it would refund any of those affected.\nIt said hackers stole from its Ethereum coin digital wallet. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by value after Bitcoin.\nBybit's founder Ben Zhou said the money could be covered by the firm or by a loan from partners. Bybit holds $20bn (£15bn) in assets.\nBybit said the hackers exploited security features, then transferred the money to an unidentified address.\nAfter the theft, the value of Ethereum fell by around 4% on Friday, leaving it worth $2,641.41 (£2,090) per coin.\nThe scale of the theft would exceed a previous record, which was a $620m (£490m) heist of Ethereum and USD Coin from the Ronin Network in 2022.\nBybit was founded in 2018. US President Donald Trump and former Paypal chief Peter Thiel were reportedly among its early investors.\nBybit says it has more than 60 million users worldwide and offers access to various cryptocurrencies.\n\"Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,\" Mr Zhou added.\nThe company said\nin a post on X\nthat it had reported the case to authorities and that it was working \"quickly and extensively\"  to identify the hackers.\nCryptocurrencies, which have become popular with investors, have sparked division as many criticise their value for being based purely on speculation, allowing their value to be easily manipulated.\nMost recently, Donald Trump has been criticised for launching his own digital coin while saying he \"doesn't know much\" about the cryptocurrency.\nThe digital coin called TRUMP appeared on his social media accounts ahead of his inauguration and quickly became one of the most valuable crypto coins, but has since fallen significantly in value.\nIt highlights security concerns within the digital currency market, which was hoping for renewed trust after Mr Trump launched his coin. His adviser and and multi-billionaire owner of Tesla, Elon Musk, has also in the past talked up Bitcoin.\nIn 2014, crypto exchange Mt Gox\nfiled for bankruptcy\nafter $350m (£210m) worth of digital currency had been stolen due to a loophole in its security.\nIn 2019, hackers stole stolen\n$41m worth of Bitcoin\nfrom the Binance exchange in another major crypto-currency heist.\nRelated stories\nArgentina president faces impeachment calls over crypto crash\n'A mockery': Trump's new meme-coin sparks anger in crypto world\n'This battle is my 9 to 5 - I won't stop until I have my £620m of Bitcoin back'\nBitcoin\nCryptocurrency"

                "Sinner 'has timed it all as sweetly as one of his whiplash forehand'\n(Image credit: Andy Cheung / Contributor / Getty Images)\nBy\nThe Week UK\npublished\n22 February 2025\nNick Kyrgios called it a \"sad day for tennis\"; Tim Henman said it \"leaves a pretty sour taste\". Last Saturday, it was announced that the world's best player, Jannik Sinner, had negotiated a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over offences committed last March, and would be banned for just three months.\nSinner twice tested positive for the\nbanned steroid\nclostebol, said Stuart Fraser in\nThe Times\n. He claimed the substance had entered his system accidentally, as a result of it being present in an over-the-counter spray used by his physiotherapist to treat a small wound. And last August, a tribunal cleared Sinner of any wrongdoing. But that decision was appealed by\nWada\n, on the grounds that even if the Italian wasn't personally at fault, he was still responsible for mistakes by his team. At a hearing scheduled for April, Wada said it would seek a one-year ban. But a compromise agreement has been reached which bans Sinner until 4 May – allowing him to return for the French Open.\nThis outcome fits Sinner's interests so precisely as to almost seem like no punishment at all, said Simon Briggs in\nThe Daily Telegraph\n. Had his ban started after Wada's appeal was due to be heard, he would have missed both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. As it is, he will be able to put his feet up during the \"dog days of late winter and early spring\", before returning for the crucial summer tournaments.\nSubscribe to\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

Sinner's case, and that of women's No. 2\nIga Swiatek\n(who last year received a month-long ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance), contrast starkly with that of some lower-ranked players. Take Britain's Tara Moore, who in 2022 was banned after testing positive for nandrolone metabolites and Boldenone. After 19 months of tortuous wrangling, \"the source was found to be contaminated meat at a local restaurant\", and Moore was cleared. But \"the saga evaporated her life savings and stuck her £200,000 in debt\". Her career has never recovered. Sinner gets a free pass; yet when lower-ranked players face career-threatening charges, the sport does next to nothing to help.\nSome action is at least on the horizon, said Charlie Eccleshare on\nThe Athletic\n. The Professional Tennis Players Association recently announced plans to give all players access to pro-bono legal support. That may help players in Moore's situation, but won't do much to shift the general perception that tennis is a sport that gives \"preferential treatment\" to its elites. The \"two-tiered resentment\" this generates, and which Sinner's case has so clearly illustrated, \"does not look likely to fade away any time soon\".\nExplore More\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe Week UK\nLatest\nCrossword: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku hard: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nSudoku medium: February 22, 2025\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\nBy The Week Staff\nPublished\n22 February 25\nYou might also like\nWhen 'a kiss is not a kiss': Spanish football on trial\nTalking Point\nLuis Rubiales faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail if convicted of sexually assaulting footballer Jenni Hermoso\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n15 February 25\nDenis Law obituary: fond farewell to 'the King of the Stretford End'\nIn the Spotlight\nScottish footballer who was one of Manchester United's 'Holy Trinity' has died aged 84\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n25 January 25\nWhy Man United finally lost patience with ten Hag\nTalking Point\nAfter another loss United sacked ten Hag in hopes of success in the Champion's League\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n3 November 24\nGeoff Capes obituary: shot-putter who became the World’s Strongest Man\nIn the Spotlight\nThe 'mighty figure' was a two-time Commonwealth Champion and world-record holder\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n2 November 24\nDignity in defeat\nOpinion\nChicago White Sox players during a baseball game in Detroit, Michigan\nBy Theunis Bates\nPublished\n1 October 24\nRaygun: heir to Eddie the Eagle?\nTalking Point\nAustralian Olympic breakdancer Rachael Gunn has become 'a worldwide meme'\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n24 August 24\nGraham Thorpe obituary: 'chameleon' batsman with 100 England caps\nIn depth\nCricketer's 'bottle in abundance' endeared him to fans\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n18 August 24\nBoxing at the Olympics: the row over sexual differences\nTalking Point\nControversy over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shines a spotlight on the murky world of gender testing – and the IOC's inaction\nBy The Week UK\nPublished\n10 August 24\nView More ▸"

He has been consistent with his criticism ever since an independent inquiry of ITIA concluded that Sinner bore “\nno fault or negligence”\ndespite failing the dope test twice at the Indian Wells. Kyrgios called the ITIA’s verdict “\nridiculous”\nback then. It’s no surprise that he is not overly amused about WADA’s out-of-court settlement with Sinner now which has let the Italian get away with just a 3-month ban. Kyrgios’ criticism of Sinner is drawing him backlash on social media, but the Aussie, as usual, remains unapologetic, refusing to bow down from his stance.\nRecently, a fan page shared a futuristic scenario on X, featuring Nick Kyrgios in 2084, where he is old but not over Jannik Sinner’s doping case. “\nDid I tell you about the time Jannik Sinner failed two doping tests? The whole system is rigged! Why won’t the establishment do anything? This is why I never won a big title,”\nthe fan page wrote in the caption mocking Kyrgios who, according to them, would talk about this doping controversy even in 2084. The post instantly went viral,\ndrawing reactions from many including Boris Becker.\n“\nLol,”\nthe German legend commented in reply to the post.\nKyrgios, quite naturally, didn’t like that comment and brought up Becker’s past to shut him up. For those unversed, Becker, a Wimbledon singles champion at 17, served 8 months of 2 and half years of sentence in 2022 for concealing and transferring money during a bankruptcy process. He was also convicted of tax evasion in Germany in 2002. Referring to these court cases involving Becker, Kyrgios replied, “\nWhat’s up criminal\n.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s up criminal\n— Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios)\nFebruary 21, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nKyrgios’ criticism against Sinner is often said to have been motivated by his “\nbitterness.”\nWhen Sinner’s doping ordeal first came to the public eye, Kyrgios wrote on X, “\nWhether it was accidental or planned. You get tested twice with a banned  (steroid) substance… you should be gone for 2 years. Your performance was enhanced. Massage cream…. Yeah, nice 🙄”\nThe Aussie was clearly not convinced of Sinner’s claim that the substance entered his body through his ex-physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi’s massage, who used a spray containing Clostebol to treat his cut. Not only did Kyrgios slam Sinner, but he also took a harsh dig at whoever supported the Italian, including former World No. 1 Andy Roddick, whom he accused of taking performance-enhancing drugs.\nHowever, Kyrgios refuted the claims of his criticism being fueled by any bitterness. “\nHaha, I’m not bitter at all. It’s not about Sinner. I just called his match 🤣 thoroughly enjoyed it. It could have been anyone in that position – I just want fairness. But as for you, I’ll reply and help you get engagement as you are really struggling in that department 🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♂️🏃,”\nhe said.\nOn the flip side, Kyrgios’ feud with Becker dates back to 2023. It started when he commented on Boris Becker’s era, expressing doubt about the old players’ skills compared to modern generation players.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Nick Kyrgios right to call out Jannik Sinner, or is he just bitter about his career?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nWhen Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker argued over the potential of Tennis’ past eras and its players\n“\nThe game was so slow back then, I’ve watched Boris Becker and I’m not saying they weren’t good in their time, but to say that they would be just as good now, it’s absurd,”\nKyrgios said to The Athletic in 2023. His comment received criticism from Becker who said in Das Gelbe vom Ball podcast,\n“Everyone can think what he wants. You have to have respect for the past and simply say ‘thank you’ out loud that these old pros existed because without them the tennis circus would no longer exist.”\nBecker also took a dig at Kyrgios’ record, emphasizing his inability to win a major title. “\nNick makes a lot of noise about tennis lately!?! Why does he speak about a sport he hates …fact-check Nick has never won a major championship as a player or coach( yes doubles 1) so where is any credibility coming from? Trying to compare generations,\n” the German wrote on X in December 2023.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nKyrgios was never going to hold back. He reflected on his record of beating Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray to press his point further. “\nAlso I mean I’ve beaten, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, Murray so I feel like I have a little credibility…. But it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that Novak would wipe the floor against you in your prime. Like it’s not an attack. It’s just facts,”\nKyrgios wrote on X as well.\nBe it his feud with Boris Becker or his criticism of Jannik Sinner, Kyrgios has shown time and again that he isn’t the one to bow down from his stance. But how long will he keep going after Sinner?\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nIs Nick Kyrgios right to call out Jannik Sinner, or is he just bitter about his career?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"

However, that statement might seem ironic to some fans and players who have voiced their opinion on his doping controversy since WADA announced that he has accepted their proposal for a three-month ban on February 15! The ban, effective from February 9 to May 4, follows two positive tests for the banned substance clostebol from last March. While Sinner initially avoided sanctions, WADA’s appeal prompted this settlement, allowing him to return just before the French Open. Critics, including\nNick Kyrgios\n, labeled it a\n“sad day for tennis,”\nquestioning the timing of the ban and suggesting favoritism since it falls between major tournaments. But the backlash against Sinner continues.\nSinner’s doping saga began in March 2024 after he tested positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid. While an independent tribunal initially found him not significantly at fault, WADA appealed by September, seeking accountability from Sinner’s team. Sinner maintained his innocence, claiming inadvertent exposure during physiotherapy. WADA’s General Counsel, Ross Wenzel, stated there was no partial treatment, and the timing was coincidental, asserting the agency is\n“blind to the calendar,”\na claim that was not well-received.\nRemember when Stanislas Wawrinka posted on X,\n“I don’t believe in a clean sport anymore,”\namassing significant fan interaction? Kyrgios, who has been vocal, responded,\n“You and me both.”\nOn top of that, the conversation only escalated when it was pointed out that WADA’s statement noted Jannik could resume training on April 13. As Olly Tennis shared a snippet from Tennis Italiano on X, stating,\n“According to the ITIA – a player can train with his support staff, as long as he does not do so in a place connected to a national association, the ATP, the ITF, the WTA, the Grand Slams or an event covered by our regulations.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\n🇮🇹💪 Jannik Sinner WILL be able to train before the April 13th ‘training ban’ end date:\n“According to the ITIA – a player can train with his support staff, as long as he does not do so in a place connected to a national association, the ATP, the ITF, the WTA, the Grand Slams or…\npic.twitter.com/XX8mTobhH0\n— Olly Tennis 🎾🇬🇧 (@Olly_Tennis_)\nFebruary 21, 2025\nExpand Tweet\nThis allows the 2025 Australian Open champion time to prepare for Roland Garros on May 25, a detail that sparked negative reactions from fans.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nFans lash out at Sinner’s ban after revelation of his training dates\nFans have voiced mixed reactions, confusion, skepticism, and frustration, to Jannik Sinner’s three-month doping ban.\n“This suspension feels less and less like a suspension. It’s almost like a billionth of a suspension 🤷🏻‍♂️,”\none fan quipped. The theme seems to be universal, with the British broadcaster slamming the situation as a\n“joke,”\nespecially the idea of negotiating drug offense punishments. He questioned Sinner’s\n“settlement”\nwith WADA on X. Many are questioning the fairness. One fan wondered,\n“It would be great to see an explanation on this; other banned players were not permitted to train at all. How does this situation differ, I wonder?”\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nDoes Sinner's 'ban' expose a double standard in tennis doping penalties?\nHave an interesting take?\n0\nDebate\nAnalysts have compared this case to past ones. Former ATP pro-Andy Roddick pointed out a similar occurrence on his podcast. He noted,\n“[Marco] Bortolotti, who is an Italian player, his career-high doubles ranking is 102… Bortolotti goes through and proves that there was no intent. Guess what he got suspended for? Zero, nothing, not three months.”\nRoddick compared the case to shunning allegations of favoritism.\nThe sentiment that Sinner is getting off easy is palpable, given the ban’s timeline.\n“So there is no training ban 🤡,”\none fan pointed out. Others noted his quick return to the court.\n“He already trained on Feb 13, 4 days since the ban in Doha. You don’t have to tell him that he can have a jolly good hit at a local park,”\none stated. WADA stated Sinner’s ban began on February 9, yet he was confirmed to compete at the Qatar Open starting on the 17th and spotted practicing at the arena days before.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\n“He’s just been given time to rest and work on his game for a few months, probably making him even better…You have to wonder what kind of ‘ban’ this is?”\nsome fans speculated. It seems like a popular opinion amongst many who have heard of the case, even outside the sport. Former British footballer Liam Brady even weighed in on BBC Sport. He noted that people he spoke with said,\n“It’s kind of like a Premier League footballer being banned over the summer.”\nOne frustrated fan simply exclaimed,\n“Dear Lord… 😡,”\ncapturing the emotions of many. Sinner’s case is drawing comparisons to stricter penalties faced by others, like\nSimona Halep\n, who was initially banned for nearly four years before it was reduced to nine months. Meanwhile, Sinner will remain off the court until after May 4. The debate will likely continue as Sinner has remained silent so far. Will we hear from the Italian soon?\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\n0\nDebate\nADVERTISEMENT\n0\nDebate\nDebate\nWhat's Your Perspective On\nDoes Sinner's 'ban' expose a double standard in tennis doping penalties?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEssentiallySports is a digital-first sports media house that surfaces the best stories on America's favorite sports celebrities with a fan's perspective to 30+ M average monthly readers.\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nEssentiallySports\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nAuthors\nEditorial Team\nBehind The Scenes\nHumans of EssentiallySports\nContact Us\nPress\nFAQs\nOur Brands\nES Think Tank\nEssentially Athletics\nShe Got Game\nEssentially Golf\nLucky Dog on Track\nFanCast\nSports\nAll\nBoxing\nGolf\nNASCAR\nNBA\nNFL\nTennis\nUFC\nWNBA\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nGymnastics\nOlympics\nMLB\nSoccer\nSwimming\nPrivacy Policy\nES Pressroom\nEthics Policy\nFact-Checking Policy\nCorrections Policy\nCookies Policy\nGDPR Compliance\nTerms of Use\nEditorial Guidelines\nOwnership and funding Information\nFull Spectrum Services LLP ©\n2025\n|\nAll Rights Reserved"
