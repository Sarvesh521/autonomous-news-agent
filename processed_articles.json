Mandatory Credit: Rick Scuteri-US Presswire Copyright Rick Scuteri\nNASCAR\nA Glimpse Back: Dale Earnhardt Sr.’s 1986 Richmond Race and a Bygone Era of NASCAR\nFebruary 24, 2025 | 10:03 AM EST\nDale Earnhardt Sr. earned his reputation as ‘The Intimidator’ after the dramatic 1986 Richmond Race, where he was involved in a controversial wreck that brought the wrath of\nNASCAR\ndown on him.\n50 years ago, the Richmond Race was already fraught with showdown after showdown, with several yellow cards dished out and clashes at almost every turn. In the final lap, Earnhardt and Darrell Waltrip went toe-to-toe at Richmond Fairgrounds Raceway, both eying the win.\nHowever, both drivers were involved in a controversial crash, allowing Kyle Petty to sneak past the carnage and steal the win. That win gave Petty his first career\nNASCAR\nWinston Cup Series victory.\nNASCAR Came Down Heavily on Dale Earnhardt Sr.\nWith 299 laps to go on that fateful night 50 years ago, Earnhardt was leading the race. As the driver entered the final few laps, Waltrip edged past Earnhardt. Trying to get back into the lead, Earnhardt’s No. 3 Chevrolet clipped Waltrip’s bumper and sent him spinning into the wall. The crash that followed took out the top four, and easing his way through the pile-up, Petty went from fifth to clinch his first Winston Cup Series win.\nAfter the late crash, NASCAR penalized Earnhardt for reckless driving and fined him $5,000. They also put him on probation for the rest of 1986.\nFebruary 23, 1986: One of NASCAR's most memorable moments of the last 50 years, the wild Cup race from Richmond Fairgrounds. Kyle Petty won his first race after the top-4 crash in the closing laps.\nAfter the late crash, NASCAR penalized Earnhardt for reckless driving, fining…\npic.twitter.com/VLJVqrC06N\n— nascarman (@nascarman_rr)\nFebruary 23, 2025\nEarnhardt, who admitted his mistake, denied he did it on purpose. He said, “I misjudged the distance between the cars. I turned him sideways. It’s my fault; I’m not denying that. I made a mistake and hit him. But I don’t think I’m guilty of reckless driving or wrecking somebody purposely. It was an accident.”\nHowever, NASCAR was having none of it. The then-NASCAR vice president Bill Gazaway said, “There is a fine line between hard racing and reckless driving, and Earnhardt clearly stepped over that line Sunday. We cannot tolerate or condone such actions. We must preserve the integrity of our sport.”\nThe fine and probation on Earnhardt had set the tone. NASCAR was not going to be a push-over, and they had just used arguably the toughest driver to make their point.\nArticle written by\nLeandra Monteiro\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddIt\nFlip\nLinkedin\nEmail\nMore from PFSN\n‘I’ll Wreck His A**’ – Kyle Busch’s Direct Threat to Carson Hocevar Following Atlanta Carnage\n‘He’s Just a Moron!’ Ryan Blaney Unleashes Fury on Carson Hocevar\nDaytona/Talladega’s ‘Buffoon’ Tactics Exposed, Crew Chief Explains Why Atlanta Is NASCAR’s True Pack Racing\n‘NASCAR Must Fix Superspeedway Racing Now’ – Drivers’ Frustration Erupts Over Daytona, Talladega\n‘He’s Making a Lot of Bold Moves’ — Kyle Busch Delivers Brutal Assessment of Aggressive NASCAR Rookie\nIs Austin Cindric’s Luck Running Out?

However, with one team moving in a very positive direction, I think there’s a pretty clear path to profit out in Utah this evening.\nPortland Trail Blazers vs. Utah Jazz Best Bet\nAfter a 13-28 start to the season, Portland has won 11 of 16 games. That’s an impressive run for a young team no matter who the success has come against, but those five defeats came against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves, the rested Los Angeles Lakers, and the Denver Nuggets twice.\nFor five weeks, we’ve seen the Blazers handle their business against non-elite teams at a high level, and last I checked, the Jazz certainly fall into that bucket.\nIn 8 February games, Scoot Henderson has played 30 minutes or less each time, averaging 24.7 mpg\nDespite that, he averages 11.6 points, 2.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.3 steals on 44/38/88 shooting\nAND he’s a team high +80 in February, with 2nd at +45\npic.twitter.com/sJDQZ6OfJg\n— Point Made Basketball (@pointmadebball)\nFebruary 23, 2025\nFor the season, Portland ranks 19th in rebound rate, an underwhelming number given its roster build, but not one that is reflective of the current direction. They’ve pulled down 52.1% of misses over their past 16 games (they’ve won the rebound battle in 11 of their past 14), a trend that fills me with optimism in this spot against a Utah team that … struggles when they can’t dominate the glass.\nJazz Splits\nTop-22 Rebound Rate Games: 11 wins and 11 losses\nAll Other Games: 3 wins and 31 losses\nThe last time we saw Utah was Saturday night when, on the second night of a back-to-back, they upset a Houston Rockets team that we all like. They scored 27+ points in all four quarters against one of the better defenses in the\nNBA\n, shot 62.1% from inside the arc, and got a “see what is possible” game from Keyonte George (30 points, eight rebounds, six assists, and zero turnovers in 29 minutes off the bench).\nEverything went right, and every team in the NBA has the potential. Less than half the teams, however, can play at a high level for the majority of their games, and bad teams, like Utah, find a way to regress in a major way in short order.\nThey’ve won consecutive games three times over the past 380 days.\nLet that marinate for 15 seconds.\nThat’s hard to do in a league where night-to-night effort from the opposition isn’t a given.\nOK, have you digested that nugget yet?\nTry this one.\nThe\nKansas City Chiefs\nhave both won and lost a\nSuper Bowl\nsince the last time Utah won consecutive games and both were played at home.\nYikes.\nThat’s what they are trying to accomplish tonight, against a young team that is moving in the right direction. I’ll lay the number and play this game live should the Blazers struggle out of the gate (-2.8 points per game in first quarters this season, third-worst).\nPick: Trail Blazers -3.5 (-112, FanDuel)\nArticle written by\nKyle Soppe\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddIt\nFlip\nLinkedin\nEmail\nMore from PFSN\nNuggets vs. Pacers Prediction: Embrace the Bounceback With Denver\nTimberwolves vs. Thunder Prediction: Gaining an Edge in a Rematch\nNets vs. Wizards Prediction: Cashing a Ticket on the Ugliest Game of Monday\nNBA Fans React to Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, Mavs GM Nico Harrison Chatting Courtside After Luka Dončić Trade\nWATCH: 4-Time Champion Draymond Green Taunts Mavericks in Final Moments of Warriors’ Dominant Win\nMagic Johnson Believes Lakers’ Big 3 of Luka Dončić, LeBron James, Austin Reaves Just Took a Major Step Toward Contending\nRelated Articles\nNuggets vs. Pacers Prediction: Embrace the Bounceback With Denver\nFebruary 24, 2025 | 9:49 AM EST\nTimberwolves vs. Thunder Prediction: Gaining an Edge in a Rematch\nFebruary 24, 2025 | 9:27 AM EST\nNets vs. Wizards Prediction: Cashing a Ticket on the Ugliest Game of Monday\nFebruary 24, 2025 | 9:07 AM EST\nNBA Fans React to Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, Mavs GM Nico Harrison Chatting Courtside After Luka Dončić Trade\nFebruary 23, 2025 | 9:45 PM EST"

LeBron James and Luka Doncic combined for 57 points on over 50% shooting with 19 rebounds, 12 assists, and just two turnovers in a convincing 123-100 win on Saturday night.\nThat’s going to happen. It’s also far less likely to happen against the Indiana Pacers.\nWhen it comes to this Nuggets vs. Pacers game, I’m not letting the stench of that performance linger. Denver had won nine straight games (albeit against inferior competition) before that dud, and I like our chances of seeing that version of them tonight in Indiana.\nNBA Pick for February 24\nDenver Nuggets vs. Indiana Pacers Best Bet\nThe game of basketball can be ultra-complicated. In this math-dominated era, advanced schemes to open up good looks are as detailed as ever, and trying to pick apart matchups to project how clean those shot attempts are going to be can be a headache.\nThis isn’t that.\nNot only do the Nuggets play differently than most (easily the lowest three-point rate in the league), they profile as a bully in this spot. They are a top-three rebounding team in the sport, a stat in which the Pacers rank bottom-three. There’s no need to overcomplicate things.\nSEE MORE:\nNBA Power Rankings All-Star Break\nBehind Nikola Jokić, Denver is on the short list of teams that have “most efficient offense in the\nNBA\n” potential on a nightly basis. If we are nearly assured a massive edge on the glass, I’m having a hard time seeing Indiana keep pace.\nThe Pacers didn’t drop a single quarter yesterday, beating down a Kawhi Leonard-less Los Angeles Clippers team. They had a 46-32 rebound edge in that convincing effort while Los Angeles took 47.1% of their shots from distance and converted just 25% of them – that doesn’t happen for Denver. The Pacers are 3-14 outright in their 17 worst rebounding games this season and we’ve seen a handful of duds from them when playing on zero rest this winter.\nDec. 4 at BKN: 90 points (35 in the first half)\nFeb. 4 at POR: 23 points loss (never led)\nFeb. 12 at WAS: Trailed by 19\nJokić is the straw that stirs the drink in Denver and could very well win another MVP award, but how about this Jamal Murray (knee) stretch?\nFILTHY HIGHLIGHTS 🏹\nHBD Jamal Murray (\n@BeMore27\n)\npic.twitter.com/BB14ziBAaE\n— Ballislife.com (@Ballislife)\nFebruary 23, 2025\nThis month, he’s averaging 25.6 points (55% FG, 49.2% 3’s, 88% FT) with nearly three assists per turnover and multiple steals in the majority of games. I’m not sure this level of play sustains, but I trust Denver’s duo far more than what Indiana has to offer.\nI like Tyrese Haliburton, but consistency isn’t a strength. It brought in Pascal Siakam from Toronto with the hope that he could be something of a stabilizing force, but – yikes. He has two good games this month in terms of his three-point shot, but in all other games in February, he’s missed 19 of 21 triples.\nThe Pacers need to be clicking on all cylinders with their offense to succeed on most nights, let alone one against a team like Denver. I’m not confident that, on the second night of a back-to-back, they perform well tonight.\nWe are getting a point or two of value because of what we just saw.

He was asked to comment on Hocevar’s driving after the race, and this is what he said:\n“He just had a lot of, lot of, lot of close calls,” the two-time\nNASCAR\nCup Series champion told NBC Sports. “I mean, he wasn’t even clear on me.

We’ve seen these playoff teams split the previous two meetings, setting us up for an interesting rubber match tonight in Oklahoma City.\nMinnesota covered the spread last night at home by a point – the oddsmakers have added four points to the number tonight as we switch locations. I’m going to refuse to take the bait and bet on either team in this spot, instead opting to target a plus-money prop.\nNBA Pick for February 24\nMinnesota Timberwolves vs. Oklahoma City Thunder Best Bet\nThe ‘Wolves are hurting and that is what made their ability to stay within touch last night impressive. Donte DiVincenzo, Julius Randle, and Rudy Gobert all sat out last night, and while there is some hope that they are trending in the right direction, I’m not overly optimistic that we get a fully extended version of any of them if they can dress.\nThat obviously hurts Minnesota’s ability to compete against arguably the best team in the sport for 48 minutes, but I’m not worried about that – I’ll embrace the narrow rotation and be on my way.\nNaz Reid pull-up 3\npic.twitter.com/MUR73tek7R\n— Timberwolves Clips (@WolvesClips)\nFebruary 24, 2025\nNaz Reid played 40 minutes last night. I’d love to pencil in some rest, if his teammates remain banged up, it’s not coming. In February, he’s giving us 34.9 minutes per game, a run that includes a pair of back-to-backs where he cleared 35 minutes on the second night twice.\nI don’t think it’s crazy to assume another 35 minutes and 16-18 shot attempts (half coming from distance) are coming, a usage pattern that I’m happy to back in a very specific way. What other choices do they have? Minnesota’s bench had a cumulative -41 plus/minus in a seven-point loss last night and they were -13 points in the eight minutes that Reid was on the pine.\nHe’s simply a tough matchup for a Thunder frontcourt that thrives closer to the rim and a backcourt that is going to pay Anthony Edwards the level of attention he deserves. Reid has reached 22 points in four straight games and seven of his past nine – get there tonight and we are sitting pretty on all fronts.\nReid has evolved into Minnesota’s Robin to Edwards’ Batman, a role that Jalen Williams has been in for the Thunder next to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for a while now. Williams is a very good player, but his team doesn’t require him to be as impactful consistently the way the Wolves do with Reid.\nWilliams Shots Per Minute\nDecember: 0.56\nJanuary: 0.50\nFebruary: 0.49\nThat may be a minor trend, but in a game with a one-sided spread where his minutes could be held in check (eight games in 13 days starting on Wednesday, including four games in four cities in six days) to a degree, something I don’t fear with Reid given the lack of reinforcements in Minnesota.\nThat’s not to say that I think Williams struggles (his 3P% has increased in consecutive months and his floor has proven to be 16 points of late). But I think his usage has more downward trajectory in this spot while Reid’s has more upward mobility.\nIn addition to a slight advantage in sheer volume, the math on Reid’s looks trumps Williams’. The Thunder allow opponents to chuck up triples on a league-high 44.9% of their attempts, a far cry from where the ‘Wolves sit (40.9%, eighth lowest).\nThere are a few ways to play this, including building in a minor hedge while opening yourself to sweeping the board.\nPick: Naz Reid to outscore Jalen Williams (+130, DraftKings)\nPick: Naz Reid and Jalen Williams to combine for over 37.5 points (-110, DraftKings)\nArticle written by\nKyle Soppe\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddIt\nFlip\nLinkedin\nEmail\nMore from PFSN\nNets vs. Wizards Prediction: Cashing a Ticket on the Ugliest Game of Monday\nNBA Fans React to Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, Mavs GM Nico Harrison Chatting Courtside After Luka Dončić Trade\nWATCH: 4-Time Champion Draymond Green Taunts Mavericks in Final Moments of Warriors’ Dominant Win\nMagic Johnson Believes Lakers’ Big 3 of Luka Dončić, LeBron James, Austin Reaves Just Took a Major Step Toward Contending\nLakers Coach J.J.

He just has no idea.”\nBlaney entered the Ambetter Health 400 with high expectations. The Penske star hoped to carry the momentum of leading the NASCAR standings after Daytona and seemed in control until the closing laps when Hocevar derailed his night.\nBlaney was having a solid run until Lap 234, when\nHocevar pulled off his frivolous stunt\n. Approaching on the low side, he clipped the rear bumper of the Penske No. 12, sending Blaney spinning.\nDespite the contact, Blaney pulled off an impressive save on the apron, avoiding major damage. Still, the incident derailed his shot at a better result. Settling for fourth, a frustrated Blaney didn’t hold back in his post-race interview with Frontstretch.\n“I think you’ve seen it for a couple of years… His overaggressiveness gets him into a lot of trouble,” he said. “I was hoping that he’d learn this past offseason, but I don’t know if he has. We’ll see if he learns. If not, someone will teach him.”\nBlaney’s words suggested that Hocevar’s driving could lead to a series of on-track repercussions. This could mean harsh treatment on the track, denied assistance, and intentional contact.\nNASCAR has had a silent code for dealing with over-aggressive drivers. If the driver refuses to clean up his act, the field will take matters into its own hands.\nBlaney confronted Hocevar post-race about his on-track behavior.\n“I mean, I told him a couple of moves he made earlier in the race that were really, really sketchy,”  Blaney revealed. “So, I just told him, ‘You gotta calm down, you know you got a lot of talent, but you got to be a little bit easier, you know, in these certain moments be a little smarter.”\nArticle written by\nSadik Hossain\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddIt\nFlip\nLinkedin\nEmail\nMore from PFSN\n‘I’ll Wreck His A**’ – Kyle Busch’s Direct Threat to Carson Hocevar Following Atlanta Carnage\nDaytona/Talladega’s ‘Buffoon’ Tactics Exposed, Crew Chief Explains Why Atlanta Is NASCAR’s True Pack Racing\n‘NASCAR Must Fix Superspeedway Racing Now’ – Drivers’ Frustration Erupts Over Daytona, Talladega\n‘He’s Making a Lot of Bold Moves’ — Kyle Busch Delivers Brutal Assessment of Aggressive NASCAR Rookie\nIs Austin Cindric’s Luck Running Out?
