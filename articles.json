        "extracted_content": "Wilson Hires Raudric Curtis As Next Football Coach \u2013 The562.org Skip to content Wilson\u2019s administration has confirmed that the Bruins have hired Mayfair assistant Raudric Curtis to be the next head coach of the Bruins. Curtis replaces Travis Clark and takes over a Bruins team that went 9-5 and finished fourth in the Moore League, but ended the season with a run to the Division 9 championship game, ultimately losing 14-13. \u201cI am honored to lead the Long Beach Wilson football program and build upon the school\u2019s championship tradition,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cWilson is primed for sustained success and I\u2019m here to take the Bruins to the next level.\u201d Curtis is a Bellflower alum with plenty of prior head coaching experience. He played college ball at Pomona-Pitzer and then coached at Bellflower and was head coach at Bosco Tech. He was the head coach at Bellflower from 2005-2017 and at Bosco Tech from 2019-2023. Most recently he was the Associate Head Coach and Assistant Defensive Coordinator at Mayfair on the Monsoons\u2019 recent CIF-SS championship squad that made it to the CIF State Finals. Curtis has drawn positive comments from those who have coached with him, including former Wilson head coach Mark Ziegenhagen, who is the defensive coordinator at Mayfair. Curtis is optimistic he can build off of the positive from last season. \u201cWilson\u2019s recent CIF appearance proves this program can win, and I\u2019m committing to building a powerhouse that competes for a Moore League title year after year,\u201d he said. Curtis\u2019 offense will be an explosive one, trying to get the teams\u2019 playmakers in space; he\u2019ll also emphasize a \u201crelentless\u201d approach on defense that jibes well with the team\u2019s identity under ZIegenhagen, both when he was the head coach and when he was defensive coordinator under Mario Morales (now the head coach at Lakewood). Fans can expect the Bruins\u2019 offense to incorporate elements of the popular Go-Go Offense utilized by UNLV. Curtis said he\u2019s hoping to keep together the core of Wilson\u2019s assistant coaching staff in addition to adding others, and said the amount of talent returning to the Bruins from last year\u2019s team is a strength. \u201cThis program has loads of talent with (several key returners) as well as the tradition and hunger to achieve more,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cI coach without fear and instill that same mentality in my players. Wilson will take the field expecting to win every game, against any opponent.\u201d Wilson AD John Janzen said the school had more than 50 applicants for the position and expressed confidence in Curtis. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of great integrity, intelligence, and possesses an amazing work ethic,\u201d he said. \u201cHis philosophy of \u2018faith through adversity breeds championship spirit\u2019 will instill confidence in our student-athletes and build character as they develop both on and off the field.\u201d Mike Guardabascio An LBC native, Mike Guardabascio has been covering Long Beach sports professionally for 13 years, with his work published in dozens of Southern California magazines and newspapers. He's won numerous awards for his writing as well as the CIF Southern Section\u2019s Champion For Character Award, and is the author of three books about Long Beach history. http://The562.org Related Articles Cabrillo Football Cabrillo Football Unable to Field Team For Abridged 2020-21 Season March 11, 2021 March 11, 2021 Tyler Hendrickson The current school year has produced more than its fair share of challenges for any coach, much less a first-year head coach looking to make their mark on a program.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images) TOPICS: Nevada football 2025 schedule Opponents ranking Postseason path Mountain West Bowl teams Jeff Choate Penn State One year after playing arguably the most difficult schedule in program history, Nevada football will have an easier path to the postseason in 2025. In 2024, the Wolf Pack played eight bowl opponents, two College Football Playoff teams and was the only Mountain West school to play all five bowl teams from the league. The 2025 schedule includes six bowl teams from a season ago, so there are plenty of challenges, but it is not expected to be as rigorous as what the team faced in Jeff Choate's first season. Below we rank Nevada's 2025 opponents from easier to hardest. 12. vs. Sacramento State (Sept. 6): The annual FCS foe goes in the first spot. The Hornets went 3-9 last season, including 1-7 in the Big Sky, as head coach Andy Thompson resigned to take a coordinator job at Stanford. Sac State hired former UNLV offensive coordinator Brennan Marion, whose Rebels scored 38 and 45 points against Nevada the last two seasons. He won't have as much talent in his first year at Sac State as he had at UNLV but could put together a scrappy effort at Mackay Stadium. 11. vs. Middle Tennessee (Sept. 13): Middle Tennessee has generally been a solid Group of 6 football program, although it is coming of back-to-back bowl-less seasons, including last year's 3-9 mark and 2-6 record in Conference USA under first-year coach Derek Mason, who previously was Vanderbilt's head coach. The Blue Raiders were outscored by 16.1 points per game last season and ranked bottom 15 in scoring offense and scoring defense, so there's a long way for this team to go. 10. at New Mexico (Oct. 18): Here's another Nevada opponent breaking in a first-year head coach who has had success against the Wolf Pack. New Mexico hired Jason Eck from Idaho with Eck's Vandals beating the Wolf Pack, 33-6, in 2022. The Lobos lost a lot of talent to the transfer portal, including star QB Devon Dampier to Utah. Nevada should have the talent edge in Wolf Pack football's first trip to Albuquerque since 2016, that being a lightning-delayed that took almost five hours. 9. at Wyoming (Nov. 22): Wyoming failed to become bowl eligible last season for the first full season since 2015. First-year head coach Jay Sawvel's squad showed slippage on defense (28.3 ppg allowed, up from 22.3 ppg) and was its typical self in struggling to score the ball (19.3 ppg, 11th worst in the nation). Wyoming hasn't been dinged too heavily by the transfer portal, although the Cowboys are a low-ceiling program. This is Nevada's first trip to Laramie since 2019. 8. vs. San Diego State (Oct. 11): SDSU's first season under head coach Sean Lewis didn't show the offensive growth expected with the Aztecs' three wins being their fewest since 2008. SDSU also lost starting QB Danny O'Neil (Wisconsin) via transfer, replacing him with Michigan transfer Jayden Denegal, a former top-20 quarterback recruit in his class. SDSU is coming off back-to-back seasons without a bowl for the first time since 2008-09 and it could be three straight seasons. 7. at Utah State (Nov. 8): Utah State poached Bronco Mendenhall from MW counterpart New Mexico this offseason, and Mendenhall is an excellent coach who should quickly turn around the Aggies, who went 4-8 last season under an interim head coach but have generally been a bowl-caliber team in their MW era (nine bowls in 12 seasons). Nevada and Utah State have only played once in the previous four seasons with the Wolf Pack going 0-4 in Logan since 2009. 6. at Fresno State (Oct. 4): Five of Nevada's 12 opponents will be led by first-year head coaches, including Fresno State's Matt Entz, the former North Dakota State head coach. The Bulldogs lost offensive standouts QB Mikey Keene (Michigan), RB Malik Sherrod (Boise State) and WR Jalen Moss (Arizona State) to transfer from a 2024 team that was so-so (plus-1.3 scoring margin). Fresno State could be in line for a mild rebuild this season. 5. at Western Kentucky (Sept. 20): Western Kentucky is one of two Conference USA teams Nevada will play this season after not playing a C-USA opponent since UTEP in 2019. Under coach Tyson Helton, the Hilltoppers have won at least eight games in four straight seasons, going 24-8 in league play during that period. Western Kentucky's offense has gone from second to 15th to 47th to 92nd in the nation in scoring the last four seasons, so that trend is not super positive. 4. vs. San Jose State (Nov. 15): Nevada hosts a SJSU team coming off three straight bowl seasons for the first time in school history. Ken Niumatalolo will be in his second season as head coach, so while there have been some key losses to transfer or graduation, the Spartans have had success in the portal and return QB Walker Eget. This should be another solid SJSU team with the Spartans finishing with seven wins in four of the last five seasons. 3. vs. UNLV (Nov. 29): UNLV enters the Dan Mullen era after Barry Odom went 20-8 in two seasons with the Rebels, or 20-5 against non-Boise State teams. Nevada has lost three straight Fremont Cannon games for the first time since losing five in a row from 2000-04, so winning this game will be preeminent for the Wolf Pack. It won't be easy, although UNLV lost as much talent as any school in the MW this offseason (10 all-league players). Mullen has rebuilt the talent base to a degree. 2. vs. Boise State (Oct. 25): The Broncos enter the post-Ashton Jeanty era as he was college football's most important player in 2024. Even without him, Boise State will be plenty talented next season as its visits Reno for perhaps the last time with the Broncos among the five MW schools joining the Pac-12 in 2026. The long-time rivalry began in 1971 with Boise State leading the all-time series 32-14, including an 18-2 mark in the last 20 matchups. 1. at Penn State (Aug. 30): Nevada opens the season against a team that played into the College Football Playoff semifinals last season, Penn State, so this will be a massive challenge for the Wolf Pack. It will be one of the largest venues Nevada has ever played in with Beaver Stadium's official seating capacity being 106,572. Among the Nittany Lions' top returners is QB Drew Allar, a potential first-round draft pick with a strong senior season. Columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.

Ukraine\u2019s domestic league has managed to play on after an initial six-month pause but resources are scarce and the long-term outlook remains uncertain. Palkin claimed the world governing body had kept its doors \u201cclosed to us\u201d and he repeated previous entreaties for the creation of a fund to help maintain a sport that has endured severe physical and financial damage. He also urged Fifa and Uefa to hold firm on their commitment to bar Russian teams from international competitions amid an increasingly precarious geopolitical climate. Liverpool face PSG as Champions League last-16 draw sets up Madrid derby Read more \u201cFrom the beginning of the war Fifa never supported Ukrainian football,\u201d Palkin told the Guardian. \u201cThey always had a slogan that we are one family, but it was not one family. They forgot about Ukrainian football completely. \u201cWe need to set up some kind of fund for Ukrainian football and the major donors should be Fifa. They should support us because we have a lot of destroyed infrastructure and a poor economic situation in the industry. It\u2019s difficult to survive in these conditions and it\u2019s strange they completely ignore what\u2019s going on in Ukraine . For me, it\u2019s some kind of shame.\u201d Palkin claimed there had been a reluctance on Fifa\u2019s part to get around the table and discuss Ukraine\u2019s plight. \u201cFifa\u2019s door is always closed for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to knock at this door in the last three years but there were no answers at all. I contacted some people at a high level in football and they also tried to communicate with Fifa, but I don\u2019t feel we have success.\u201d Shakhtar sought \u00a343m of damages from Fifa in 2022 after it ruled that foreign players in Ukraine could suspend their contracts because of the invasion, essentially depriving clubs of potentially hefty transfer fees. They eventually lost their case at the court of arbitration for sport. \u201cFifa ignored Ukraine and our clubs,\u201d Palkin said. Asked why he believed Fifa may be reluctant to create a reparations fund or provide further assistance, Palkin said: \u201cIn the past three years many people asked the same question, but I don\u2019t know at all. We can make guesses, but I don\u2019t have the answer.\u201d View image in fullscreen Infantino and Trump in 2018. Amid Trump\u2019s hostility towards Ukraine, Palkin has reiterated the need for Fifa\u2019s ban on Russian teams to remain. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Last February Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, met his Ukrainian Association of Football counterpart, Andriy Shevchenko, in Paris and pledged to \u201csupport the continuous growth on and off the pitch\u201d of football in Ukraine. Shevchenko acknowledged the value of existing Fifa programmes, such as the Fifa Forward campaign, in backing the sport\u2019s development in Ukraine. The Fifa Foundation has also helped deliver humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, allocating $1m to the cause in March 2022. Palkin was speaking days before the anniversary of the full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022, which savagely escalated a decade-long war that has forced Shakhtar to play away from their home city since 2014. Fifa and Uefa acted swiftly three years ago to prevent Russian sides playing in their competitions but, in a fraught international climate and with a volatile US administration appearing openly hostile to Ukraine, Palkin reiterated the need for them to hold the line. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is scant chance of such an occurrence and Palkin said the authorities\u2019 stance must remain while the war continues. \u201cAt this moment I don\u2019t feel Fifa or Uefa would like to give permission to Russian clubs to participate in European competition,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they have separate conversations but officially they keep their position. For Ukraine it\u2019s very important to have a strong position from Fifa and Uefa in respect of Russian teams. It\u2019s not possible, when you invade a country, that at the same time you\u2019re free to do whatever you want.\u201d Palkin does not see danger in the proximity between Fifa and the US government. \u201cFor us the face of Fifa didn\u2019t change since the beginning of the war. I don\u2019t know what kind of relationships they have, but I don\u2019t feel any changes regarding Ukrainian football. I don\u2019t understand how it can be worse and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s become better.\u201d Fifa was contacted for comment.
