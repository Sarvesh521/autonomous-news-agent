        "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz has kicked off 2025 with a promising start, securing his first title of the year at the Rotterdam Open after a strong performance following his defeat at the Australian Open. Despite losing to Novak Djokovic in Melbourne, where he reached the quarter-finals for the second consecutive year, Alcaraz bounced back by defeating Alex de Minaur in the final, lifting his 17th career trophy.\n\nAfter his victory in Rotterdam, Alcaraz faced a setback with a shock defeat to Jiri Lehecka in Doha. However, the 21-year-old Spaniard is now focused on upcoming Masters tournaments in the U.S., where his serve has been a hot topic of discussion on the ATP Tour.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick Kyrgios made a triumphant return to the circuit after nearly two years away due to severe knee and wrist injuries. Despite reaching the finals of the Brisbane International as the 2018 champion, he faced an early exit in the first round against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. His doubles run with Novak Djokovic also ended prematurely, losing to top seeds Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus in the second round.\n\nKyrgios' attempt to reignite his dominant form, as seen in his 2015 Madrid Open victory over Roger Federer, has been hindered by recent setbacks and ongoing fitness concerns. Despite these challenges, he continues to seek inspiration from wholesome moments off the court.\n\nNotably, Patrick Mouratoglou, Naomi Osaka's coach, offered insights into Alcaraz's serve, praising its relaxed nature and efficiency. His comments highlighted the improvements Alcaraz has made this year, drawing attention to his improved serving technique on the ATP Tour."
