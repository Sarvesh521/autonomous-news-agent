        "summary": "The Minister for District in-charge, Satish Jarkiholi, has issued a plea to Kannada organizations to cancel their planned \"Belagavi Chalo\" protest scheduled for February 25. The protest was in response to an incident involving a bus conductor from the NWKRTC, which sparked a linguistic row. Jarkiholi emphasized that it's an isolated incident under investigation, with five suspects arrested and a counter case filed against the conductor. He urged media not to escalate tensions between Kannada and Marathi groups, stressing the importance of maintaining law and order for development. The Minister also suggested reviewing the POCSO Act case and restarting bus services soon, while condemning attacks on buses in Solapur. Discussions are ongoing with Deputy Commissioners to address border issues. Jarkiholi advised consulting the State government before making commitments to linguistic minorities or pro-Marathi groups. His statements highlight the need for peace and harmony to ensure development progresses without disturbance.",
