        "location": "Belagavi",
        "summary": "The Karnataka Transport Minister, Ramalinga Reddy, has denied allegations that a NWKRTC bus conductor was involved in molesting a minor girl. The incident occurred in the Belagavi district, where the conductor was reportedly assaulted for requesting passengers to speak in Kannada instead of Marathi. Reddy criticized the police for registering an FIR under the POCSO Act without proper investigation, claiming the case was filed to harass the conductor. He assured that justice would be sought against those who filed false charges and emphasized the support for the conductor, while also highlighting the state's commitment to protecting Kannada culture. The incident has drawn attention from local leaders and politicians, including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, as tensions rise over language issues along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border."
