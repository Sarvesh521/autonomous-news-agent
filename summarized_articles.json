        "summary": "Chris Bassitt, a veteran pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays, had a unique way to celebrate his 36th birthday on February 22, 2025. During the team's spring training game against the New York Yankees, Bassitt was spotted serving as the ball boy, a role typically assigned to someone younger or less experienced. His appearance on the field was marked by wearing a uniform displaying his fantasy football record from the previous season: \"4-10,\" reflecting his poor performance in the league.  \n\nThis wasn't just a one-time mishap; Bassitt's 2024 fantasy football season was particularly challenging, ending with a subpar 4-10 record. The gesture of donning the \"4-10\" jersey was a humorous and public acknowledgment of his struggles, adding an extra layer of embarrassment to his birthday celebrations.  \n\nBassitt's career with the Blue Jays has seen better days, notably his standout performance in 2023 when he recorded a 3.60 ERA in 200 innings and led the American League with 16 wins. However, his fantasy football mishap has become a memorable moment in his personal journey as a professional athlete.  \n\nThis story highlights the lighter side of baseball players' personalities, showing how they use humor to cope with setbacks, both on and off the field. Bassitt's experience serves as a reminder that even successful athletes face their share of challenges, whether in sports or fantasy football leagues."
